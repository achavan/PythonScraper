So I was happy to find a little gem called Giuliano, the Spa for Beauty and Wellness

The radiant reflection of total well-being and balance of body and spirit that exists within every person. The balm of natural, pure products, treatments by caring professionals, and relaxation in elegant surroundings.

These are the Giuliano elements that combine to transform you, body and soul. So come... discover your natural beauty...naturally.

Giuliano Day Spa is a winner of Boston Magazine Best of Boston and is listed as one of the top 25 salons in America by Salon Today Magazine.

I had the pleasure of having my first massage at Giuliano Day Spa. It was absolute bliss. The atmosphere they create is extremely relaxing and comfortable. The locker room and massage rooms themselves are extremely well-kept, and the staff is extremely professional. It is certainly a treat to be pampered at Giuliano.

Giuliano Day Spa is probably the most well known and most popular day spa in the city. For my mother's 50th birthday, my siblings and I chipped in and bought her a full day of services at Giuliano, and I went along to keep her company. She was a bit nervous, as she never pampers herself and did not know what to expect. She loved it!! The staff was extremely professional, respectful and understanding that it was a very significant day for my mother - you could tell they were trying hard to make it special for her. They were friendly, but not too chatty or intrusive. Every service seemed great, from the full body massage, to the manicure and pedicure, to the hair style and makeup application! We enjoyed the spa lunch as well. She left very happy and so relaxed she wanted to take a nap!:)"

For the price of $57 per adult (the most expensive Boston tour this firm offers) we were expecting a wonderful, fun time, filled with historical information. What we received could not have been further from that. The employees at the bike shop that are in charge of this tour could not have been less enthusiastic. The college student who gave the tour knew very little about the American Revolution and 2 out of the 3 bars we were taken to served us some horrible lite beer (they would not tell us the name of) and they were not historic places! We spent more time talking about the Breaking Bad finale that was playing that night that the tour guide couldn't wait to get back to his dorm to watch. At one of the bars the guide would not let us look at the table placemats because that was all he was going to tell us about the place and even then the placemat had MORE information than he did! When we asked about the snack we were supposed to receive he said that people have asked him about that before but it is not something they have ever supplied and it was not a part of the package - even though we told him it was listed on the website.
One of the bars we were taken to was directly across the street from one of the oldest bars in America. We were told that the bar we went to instead had the oldest NAME - what?! It was obvious that the local tour company took us to the places they could get the best deal (read that more profits) for themselves and did not care about living up to the tour description.
This tour is an excellent idea for Boston, but Intrepid Travels US partner that is administering it is horrible. I have provided the same feedback directly to the company. I unfortunately have to say - Stay away and save your money for one of the better tours in Boston!"

Overall, it was very good. The scheduling of the appointments were fine, which could have been confusing with a group. They offered different times and packages, but not group rates. Some of the members were new to Bella Santa and as a result, were offered a 10% promotional offer for a first time visit. They accommodated us on a Saturday afternoon which was lovely, because we were able to enjoy ourselves before and after with shopping and dinning on Newbury Street. The location is excellent and parking was not an issue with several parking lots available, however, parking validation would have been good seeing we were there almost 3 hours.

We walked off the elevator directly into the reception area, and the ambiance was relaxing and quiet with soothing music in the background. The staff moved calmly around the spa with a smile and respected your privacy. It was not overcrowded with retail, but a nice balance, and with space to move from product to product. The room temperature was perfect for a cold day. There manicures and pedicures were to the left of reception, but you would have never have guessed. The smell of lavender and ginger was a perfect blend.

As we checked in, they took our coats and offered a brief tour of the spa. We were given soft comfortable robes and slippers. The dressing room, showers and steam were clean, organized and well shelved with amenities. However, the lighting above the individual vanities was poor, and there were no makeup mirrors with magnifying abilities for that perfect eyeliner application. We were disappointed the steam room was not working that day. The dressing room staff were continuously scanning the room for cleanliness throughout our visit, which was quite impressive.

After relaxing and enjoying a variety of tea nuts, and cucumber infused water, were individually escorted into our treatments rooms and in a timely manner. All members chose facials and felt their estheticians were good to excellent. Frankly, I was the lucky enough to be paired with Jackie who had a touch only second to my usual esthetician. She spoke softly, slowly and moved confidently with ease, unlike others that had reported differently, she did not leave the room and was fully prepared. She educated me on the products, answered questions and it was not the usual hard sell, but an appropriate one. The treatment room was quite, dim and appropriately warm. The music was a bit redundant, but elegant and soothing. The products were fabulous and effective, as was Jackie.

After our treatments, we relaxed and took the time to reflect on the experience. Now, we were moving around like the staff.... Calm and peaceful.

Check out was a bit confusing because it was a group, but in the end it was fine.

I would recommend Bella Santa on Newbury Street. Please feel free to contact us at bostonspaclub@gmail.com, if you have any questions.

I had a $100 giftcard and was ready for some pampering.

I was horrified at the experience that took place for the hour that I surrendered myself to the ""SPECIALIST"" pedicurist. The spa pedicure was a quick 30 min tops, not the 60 min ""miracle treatment"" as promised. The pedicurist was snippy with me from the moment I greeted her and to be frank I could not understand what the heck she was even saying. During our time together she managed to soak my feet in cold water, shoot me dirty looks especially when looking at the bottom of my heel after my cold water soak and to my request to cut my nails shorter.

She completely skipped the massage part of the service, jumping from the loobing of my leg/foot to quickly whipping it off with a towel. oh and here's the best part. They don't have foot dryers so after slapping on some polish, she sat me in the waiting room and left.

I have had better service for $20 at a local salon. The main reason that I am so turned off is that my spa professional had a real air about her, she made me feel guilty that my old polish was still on, that I dry skin and that I took her up on her offer to bring me a cup of tea.

I was majorly disappointed. I was so excited about my spa day, and instead found myself thrilled to finally breathe some relief when the elevator doors closed upon my exit.

I have $40 left on my card and will hope to redeem it at another location.

I found Emerge by reading Boston Magazine online, it was mentioned in an article about spas on Newbury St.

The EMERGE spa menu options were extensive and 5star - the clincher for me was there was a ""Men's Club"" with a wall-mounted TV, exclusive men-only lounge, and separate treatment areas, so the hubby wouldn't have to wander the halls in his slippers surrounded by women in the spa area. Another desirable feature is that the spa is relatively new (recent major remodeled). The spa was comfortable, woods and warm colors. I could have used more comfy seating in the women's spa area. Although there was a great patio on the 4th floor for summer time, it was too cold on this trip and it was closed, and not really cozy enough in the 4th floor reception area. It seemed closed also, with an unattended smoothie bar and coffee area. It all would be great in the summer.

We did see a VIP room off the 4th floor foyer, where you can rent a suite while you get your treatments, you can order food there - not sure if you can do treatments there. May have been a good idea for us, as a couple, to have spent more time together during the day (since I was not invited in to the more cozy men's club area...)

Another great idea - we went on Jan 2 - an IDEAL day since we had the place pretty much to ourselves.

I had the warm stone massage with Bill, AWESOME - best ever. I only wish I had booked a longer session. My husband had a sports massage in the Men's Club with Deb - he said it was very good and she got some knots out (high praise from him). I also had a manicure with Maura, very good, -plus she was great for giving me insights to my next visit to Emerge and what to do around Boston.

Pros:
Access to a boat and freedom to navigate the harbor on your own (good for those with some boating experience)
Inexpensive and casually run by Don
Flexibility - Don is happy to accommodate schedules and changes if notified in advance.
New engine (2014) on the boat so it was easy to start.
Garmin GPS was able to make up for rickety boat gauges and was useful for speed/depth/navigation.
Don met with us to review the navigation, life jackets, practice maneuvering the boat, etc. before we left.

Cons:
Don is difficult to get a hold of... keep calling, call him back and call to confirm. I wouldn't trust text/email.
Older boat so gauges were not that accurate.
Because Don may be difficult to get a hold of you may find communicating with him a struggle/annoying.

Overall: We had a great time! Don said that we could reschedule if the weather looked bad but he needed to know 3 hours before our launch time because he did not want to put the boat in and bring it over just to have us change our mind. Very reasonable prices and requests. He was flexible in letting us stay out 20 minutes longer when we called to request this from the boat. Just make sure to communicate with Don to reserve, confirm and remind -- he is difficult to get in touch with but well worth it when you do!"

First, the trolleys only run until 4:30 pm. That is ridiculously early especially in the summer. They should run until about 30 minutes after most of the attractions close so 5:30 would be more appropriate! On our first ride, our trolley driver spent about 10 minutes talking about his first hand experience with the Boston marathon bombing--how he found out about and where he was on that day. It was ok to hear about it but not 10 minutes of where you were at that moment. Also, he spent much of the tour pointing out the locations of old and cancelled tv shows. Yes I liked Cheers too but surely, there are other things to talk about. He also spent about 20 minutes making fun of MIT students when we passed by the campus. Not a good ride. I haven't even mentioned the fact that they only come every 30 minutes. I would see 2-3 trolleys from other companies pass before the beantown trolley finally came. Pick another trolley company and you'll have a much better visit!"

We're we surprised!

The Beantown Tour is run by the Gray Line in Boston. We jumped on, looking forward to a comfortable and informative tour. Sorry not in the cards, no wait, much worse actually.

The bus was 20 minutes late but we waited just the same. When it arrived there was a second bus following from a competing tour company. As we jumped on the the relatively empty Beantown special, we noticed that the competing bus was full and that of the group of twenty people we waiting with, all but us were trying to get on the second bus. Bad omen you might say?

There was lots of room on our bus and seats plentiful. After sitting down we realized that the seats were not padded, were tiny and jammed together to increase capacity. There was literally no room for the average male rider, even my wife at 5'6"" was really uncomfortable. Added to this is the total lack of suspension on the bus. We hammered down the rough back streets with bone jarring alarm. The bus driver come guide was talkative. He rambled on identifying business buildings, hospitals and hotels. Not one word was ""wasted"" on local culture or history. Absolutely no reference to anything meaningful about the culture and community of one of Amercia's oldest cities. It was patently clear that this driver/tour dude had no specific information or education relating to what most riders would expect from a tour company. Frankly, a ten year old could have provided better audio background. The driver did manage to address the many transgressions of pedestrians or drivers who got in the way. He was often heard yelling at pedestrians via an outboard public address system. Still no word on the actual tour!

As we banged along, the driver announced that he would be missing two upcoming tour stops, notwithstanding an elderly couple wished to get off the bus at one of the stops.

We had experienced enough and got off the bus and took a taxi to see some sites. I understand from Trip Advisor that Beantown management responds to a multitude of complaints lodged on this site with comments outlining changes to come. I am sorry to announce that this tour company has not made serious advances or changes to improve what I must say is a rather pathetic business model that is all about making money and not really provided a good product or service to the Boston community."

",,3 of 5 stars,"Our first stop was L.A. Burdick's on Clarendon. This shop turned out to be the most generous with samples: two of their famous chocolate mice, and tiny cups of both their milk and dark hot chocolates. Not exactly July fare, but it was rich and delicious even though it's made with low fat milk. It's basically shaved chocolate bar melted with milk, according to the employee who served us. Our guide, Anne, did fill us in on some facts about the chocolate-making process while we were there.
Next stop: Hotel Chocolat on Newbury Street. This is a British company with quite a few locations over there but only this one location in the US. The company actually owns its own cacao plantation in St Lucia as well as using beans from other sources. The store manager met us outside with some dark chocolate and explained e proper way to taste chocolate to get the most from the experience.
Also on Newbury Street was Teuscher. This is a Swiss firm; they fly their chocolates in once a week. We had a champagne truffle which was utterly delightful. The shop is incredibly overdecorated and it seems that a good portion of their offering is fancy gift boxes. I was surprised to see them offering bars that were 99% cacao, as these would be so unsweetened as to be unpalatable to most people.
Next, we stopped at a place called Robin's Candy. I could not understand why this store was included on the tour. Most of their offerings and samples were not chocolate, but rather, nostalgic candies. Come on, a chocolate pudding flavored Jelly Belly? Really?
A few doors down, we walked through some sidewalk seating and down into a little deli. We were each given an amazing chocolate cookie, made on premises with Callebaut chocolate and two types of Valrhona cocoa. Absolutely amazing. They sell for $2 each.
Our final stop was a booth in the Prudential Center called Truffles, where we were each given a mini turtle candy. By this point, I was chocolated out, so I saved mine for later. Evidently, one of this place's claims to fame is the wide variety of sugar-free chocolates they manufacture. Nothing made on premises, but it is local.
Our guide Ann was personable and knowledgable, both about chocolate and about the Back Bay area. Who knew that the reason Needham is so flat is that its hills were ""harvested"" and the dirt used to fill in the swampy area to create the Back Bay neighborhood?
Despite having visited Boston many times, I'd never really explored Back Bay or Newbury Street. There are so many shops in the area that many of these chocolate vendors could easily be missed if you weren't specifically looking for them. And our group of 14 was a good group of folks, and I enjoyed chatting with them as we walked from one place to the next.
Did I sample $25 worth of chocolate? No. But I had $25 worth of a good time."

Lance checked me and asked me if I was the familiar with the 4th floor, I said no. So, he brought me to the 4th floor and because he is male he could not show me around the locker room. He explained the locker room to me at the door and then said to come back out to the desk (which was unattended) at your appt time and your specialist will meet you there. I said I'm a little early, isn't there a relaxation room that I can wait for the specialist to come receive me (this is true for every spa I've ever been). Lance said, ""oh, you can wait in the Brine room until your time."" he showed me where it was which was on the other end of the short hallway. I asked, ""Well, will the specialist come get me?"" Lance said, ""no, you have to come back out here to the desk."" I thought that seemed weird, but whatever. I proceeded to get ready in the locker room, and found out there is a little lounge area within the locker room, so I just hung out there until my time. At my time, I exited the locker room to go out to the desk to wait for my specialist. The desk was still unattended. A girl came down the hallway, who I thought was my facialist turned out she wasn't but was the attendant for the desk. She asked me, why don't you wait in the Brine room and your specialist will come get you there. I said, ""Huh, the guy that brought me up here said that I needed to wait her for me scheduled time appt and that my specialist would not come and find me."" She looked confused and said, really, he said that?' I said, ""yup!"" **Strike 1** Fast forward, now I am in the facial room and Alaina asked if I got a tour of the Pent House, I thought you would maybe be up there waiting for me. I said, ""Well, I thought I would have got a tour too, especially since I told the GUY that checked me in that I was unfamiliar with the 4th floor."" **Strike 2** After my facial, I went back to the locker room to get redressed. I had to use the restroom and then realized that there was barely enough toilet paper. There was nothing in this restroom but the toilet. No sink. No cabinet. So, there was no extra toilet paper in this room at all.**Strike 3** I came back out into the main locker room and told the bathroom attendant that there was no toilet paper in the restroom and she apologized. Did she go and put toilet paper in there? Nope. A few minutes later, had to use it again, still no toilet paper. **Strike 4** Because there was a regular attendant cleaning the locker room continuously, there was hair and lotion and drips in the sink area. The lounge area offers drinks and snacks as a result there was used cups everywhere. **Strike 5**. I did not go to the fancy spas in the expensive hotels thinking I could save money and have just a good experience in this smaller local spa. I should have. I would not recommend this spa to anyone."

As we had booked this before we left the UK we were not aware of the routes that the trolley so it was rather disappointing to discover that the trolley did not take us anywhere near Harvard Yard and we had to spend $10 to get us there by metro. Also the trolleys themselves seem as if they have seen better days and look rather tired. We ended up on the first trolley of the day and whilst the driver/guide was very good we found ourselves being in the disconcerting position that when as the only people on board we stayed on board after the first circuit he went through exactly the same patter including his jokes.

On a positive note the tour we did through the same company to Lexington and Concord as well as the aforementioned harbour cruise was excellent.

Our main complaint was the audio. After a while it became obvious that the speakers were not working properly. I spoke to the driver who said the volume was on full and suggested we move seats. This was not easy for my mum who has trouble walking and meant as a family we would all have to sit separately but we moved,but to no avail, we could still not hear a thing.

Trolleys only go in one direction meaning if you are at MIT and want to go to Fenway park it could take an hour for a five minute ride. If they added a trolley In both directions this could solve that problem.

I wish I had known this before buying a Go-Boston pass, or I would not have used this. I spend a good deal of time researching our travel sites and plan well, but somehow I missed the following point. I noted in advance what we were interested in seeing or doing in each area, prioritizing the things we wanted early in the day so we didn't miss them due to time constraints. The hop on/off option is great, but the trolley only goes the same route in the same direction, so if you want to go to the stop before you are getting on, you will have to do then entire 1.5 hour loop tour to get there!!!!! I was presuming the trolleys ran in both directions, but they don't! We are not familiar with the subway, and didn't want to negotiate that on our first trip to Boston. If you want to see different areas at different times, you may wish to check other options - perhaps other trolley or tour busses go in both directions. We did take a taxi to save time, and not only was it quick and right to the door, but the price was decent. Worse yet, the trolleys last run is at 4:30 pm!! Who wants to end their day at dinnertime?

The route they follow is the same as the other trolleys, so you get to see everything. But we found that the other trolley lines passed by two or three times before this one came by. So, you wait longer. Also seemed like we sat a lot waiting for the time to go to the next stop.

It advertises that you can get on/off as many times as you like so it seemed ideal for us. Our first day in Boston was rainy so we decided to take the trolley to get oriented and see the basic sights. Because of the rain, clear plastic coverings were pulled down to cover the open sides of the trolley. You could hardly see much through them and they didn't keep all the rain out. When people left, we moved to seats next to the few real glass windows in the trolley and we could then see much better.
Comfort gets low marks also because the seats were so closely spaced that I could not sit without turning a bit sideways so my long legs would fit behind the seat in front.
The tour guide performed the usual attempt at a comedy act - which is expected on this sort of tour.
Another negative was that the trolleys are spaced about 40 minutes apart. Some of the other trolleys would show up every few minutes while we had to wait up to 40 minutes for Beantown. This was very inconvenient if you depended on it fore frequent stops.
Finding the stops was another problem. The map they provide shows a big dot in a general area, but there is no sign at the location to let you know where you should wait. People would end up running down the block or across the street because they were waiting at the wrong spot.
My biggest complaint was that they skipped stops! While we were riding along, on two separate trolleys, we heard the radio conversation where the driver was told to bypass at least 2 stops on the route. The driver then told us that if we wanted to go to one of those stops, he would give us directions on how to walk there, and that if we wanted to catch a trolley from one of those stops that we should call and let them know that we were there waiting. What about the people who were waiting at those stops and didn't know that their stop had been bypassed? I would have been upset if that happened to me!
As a free add-on for the Boston Go card, it is fine to use as orientation ride around - but use the subways for transportation."

Maybe these things won't be the case after Memorial day. We chose it for 2 reasons, it included the Harbor tour and it looked like it got us closest to the fine arts museum we were interested in (and I also thought the entrance fee to the museum was included but although I didn't get to try it, I think it was not - the website is somewhat misleading). I am giving only 2 stars primarily because although they said they ran every 20 minutes, they did NOT. it was more like 40+ minutes. So it was very frustrating standing at a stop and watching all the other trolleys have 2 or sometimes more stop in front of us... but we had to wait. They also did their final pick up at 4 pm which was difficult for planning to go to a museum!!! if I had known that, I probably would not have chosen them. After all, the whole reason we chose a hop-on-hop-off trolley was to be able to get around the city to all the sites in the easiest way. Instead we ended up waiting for way too much of it and ended up NOT going to some places because we were afraid to miss the last pick up!
Positive aspects: Anthony definitely was a great tour guide, very funny. He gets 5 stars. He made up for a lot of the frustration at having to wait - but of course there was no way to guarantee we would be getting him or we would have to wait another 40+ minutes for the ""right"" trolley!! (the other tour guide was kind of surly, not terribly friendly).
The Harbor tour was included - that was nice at least. about a 60 minute tour - would be great in warmer weather.
Another very positive note was when we were at their main kiosk at the harbor, and had just missed a trolley, since they knew we would have to wait another 40+ minutes, they called the trolley and had them wait a few blocks up and they drove us up to it. That was very nice. I just wish they had been more honest about their timing. :("

Both guides were good. Mike, our first driver, was a little quieter, but still full of interesting and helpful information. Eric was hysterical and I appreciated his sarcastic sense of humor, although I suppose that type of humor isn't enjoyed by everyone.

Overall, I think that Beantown Trolley is a good bet. With the exception of the one competitor's trolley that left at 9:00 and those that were making the same stops as ours, I really didn't see other trolleys.

We were new to Boston, so I don't have anything to compare it to. My husband, son & I found the tour to be interesting and informative. We took the tour later in the day (2pm), so in the interest of time, decided we were not necessarily going to hop on/off unless something really hit us to make sure we saw everything before the last trolley at 5pm. A smart move on our part, since there was a Red Sox game at Fenway which caused lots of traffic & had us on the trolley for almost 3 hours.

The tour guide was polite, professional & courteous. Again, I don't know how this compares to other tours, but we enjoyed it. We all agreed we should have certainly allotted more time so that we could hop on/off & explore more. Also, I would suggest others to bear any events in mind (like a ball game) when taking such a tour, as traffic will effect you getting around.

Overall, it was a great value for us since we got this through the Go Boston package."

The bus got really hot and they couldn't switch off the heat coming from the heaters. It was a humid day, so it wasn't a pleasant experience. We stayed on the bus rather than get off as the weather was so bad - so did most people. It took about two and a half hours to get around and the last stops were missed out. Traffic was horrendous and we spent a long time standing still - it was a Friday, so maybe it isn't the best day to use these tours. Saturday traffic seemed less frantic. Some people must have been waiting quite a while for pick ups. The bus was full and if we had got off - goodness knows how long we would have to wait for a trolley to arrive.
The guide wasn't the most informative or entertaining.
Tours buses are usually a good way of getting around cities, but I don't think this is the best company. While were walking around on the Saturday we saw lots of the other companies trolleys, but very few of the Beantown trolleys.

My frustration with the tour is solely directed at the horrible driver we had. The Beantown trolley tour itself is nice, the trolleys were much less crowded than any other trolley tours and we were fortunate enough to have one wonderful driver, Anthony, who was informative, entertaining and fun. I wish we had had him for the entire tour rather than just 3 stops.

Our driver, John, was terrible. He spent the entire time talking about his mother, his job hunting, his profile on Linked In, his support group for the unemployed. I am on a tour, I am not here to network with you or find your mother a boyfriend. All the while, we were passing the sites of Boston with very little to no commentary. I have no idea what we were seeing most of the time. We hopped off once, thankfully, at Fenway. I wasn't sure if he was going to let us off, but I kept saying we wanted to get off and he finally stopped. We got back on for one stop to Cambridge, only to hop back on there and get John as our driver again. I should mention that the trolley was really late and his boss kept calling so I assume it was John and not the trolley or the traffic?! Unfortunately, this was the leg of the tour that we had planned to stay on for the longest time. Again, he continued on about his mother, his job hunt, anything but what we were actually seeing. It was boring, it was frustrating, it was a complete waste of my time. I would have gotten off and waited for another trolley but it was rainy and cold and time was getting late. I won't comment on his driving other than to say that drivers kept honking at him, repeatedly. He kept saying ""I don't know why they're honking at me, I'm in my lane"". If it happens once or twice, maybe...but that many times... I think the problem is you, John.

Boston is a beautiful city and we thought that taking the trolley was the best way to see the most in the least amount of time. John completely wasted our time and our tour. Beantown Trolley, this driver is doing a disservice to your company and your guests."

You pick it up on Sargent's whard behind the parking lot. There is no sign or anything but they will come pick you up from the small dock there.

To walk the same alleyways that were used by escaped slaves to evade slave hunters after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and the visit the Abiel Smith School, which has a place in the establishment of Jim Crow laws was haunting.

That's what brought us into Greek & International Food Market. I am SO glad we did!!
It's a lovely new spot on Washington St. in W.R. w/ a few outdoor tables. Deli style counter w/ food to go or eat outside at tables on the patio area facing Washington St. Smells delicious when you walk in. There are a few aisles where you can buy international foods/wines. The help is EXTREMELY friendly. I felt like we were friends when we left. AND they kept giving us samples! Of course we ended up buying pretty much everything we sampled it was so darn good!
The home-made yogurt is to-die-for. There was another customer next to me when we sampled the yogurt. His response ""I don't even like Greek yogurt, but this is delicious!"" I'm not kidding. I just spoke with my mother on the phone, we were both talking about, looking forward to going back. That's what prompted this review.
The tzatziki is hands down the best I've ever had. I will NEVER buy prepackaged again. Eggplant salad...I seriously can't wait to get more! It's that good. I brought home a piece of Papoutsakia ""ground beef stuffed eggplant"" and a spinach feta pie. Both were outstanding. I wanted to try the stuffed grape leaves but they only sell veggie ones. However, I will definitely buy a few of those next time. Sure to be delicious. My mother brought home a veggie stuffed pepper, and some roasted mixed vegetables, which she said were very good. Coming from her that's a huge compliment.
If you happen to be in the area, drop in and try something. I guarantee you will want to come back for more. I live near Plymouth MA and plan on going back again and again!"

We would have thought that the food establishments would have welcomed us with open arms, in aims of future repeat business, but that was not the case. People mistook our tour guide for a bakery employee giving out free samples on the sidewalk - on more than one occasion! Our tour leader was delightful, btw - no complaints there. After our 2nd stop, she called ahead to each place to make sure they were ready for us.

First of all, for $50, I would hope that we would receive a small bottle of water, some napkins and a more appropriate carrying container for the cupcakes. The bags only stored the cupcakes sideways, so they got badly squished during our walk. By the time I got home, they were inedible and ruined.

Our first stop was at Isabelle's curly cakes. We were not allowed inside because they were too busy. I got there 1/2 hour early and stood outside the shop until 11 AM and until the tour departed, not one customer entered the store. We had to stand outside, juggle our purses and bags to eat a delicious, but messy cupcake.

The next stop was a French bakery. We were not allowed inside, and had to wait 15 minutes for our samples in the foyer. We weren't supposed to use the restrooms there, but I snuck in anyway, and noticed that the staff was giving our tour leader a hard time. They cut up a piece of tasteless, dry angel food cake into tiny pieces for us to share. We felt very unwelcome there.

The 2 kids with me were tired & there weren't many places to sit along the way. I think the 10-person group would have interacted a bit more, had we been given a few tables to sit at for a few minutes each stop. Also, all but 2 of the 8 cupcake places offered us chocolate-only cupcakes. It would have been great to sample other varieties such as coconut, carrot cake or anything BUT chocolate.

Finale was fab - we were welcomed, given 3 different choices of cupcakes, and offered water and access to the restroom. Johnny Cupcakes was fantastic - the staff was great and the cupcakes were surprisingly good and really large.

It was a beautiful day out so the streets of Back Bay were so crowded, we had to walk single-file a lot of the time, making it impossible for us to chat with one another and/or the tour guide. We had to weed through the crowds and try to keep up with her.

The candy store is an unnecessary stop. We had plenty of sugar by that time, and didn't really need fudge samples or baby toothbrushes.

At Coldstone creamery, all five of us threw away our ice cream cupcakes. Although the presentation was great, they tasted terrible (like Carvel) and were too messy to eat outdoors standing up.

Suggestions:
-Better carrying containers for cupcakes; include bottled water, wet naps/napkins
-Cut the tour down to five places; require that each or every other stop provides table seating, 2-3 cupcake options and personally welcome us. Providing us with take-out menus would have been a terrific option, as I might have returned to a couple of them for office goodies.
-Allow kids to decorate their own cupcake at one place
-Add some fun facts for each stop. For example, talk about how many cupcakes they sell a week, how many pounds of butter and flour they use, how many flavors they offer, etc.
-Provide a kitchen tour of another shop, so we can watch them at work & ask questions
-Skip the candy store & coldstone creamery; lose the french bakery on Charles street
-More varieties of cupcakes; not everyone loves chocolate

I sent these suggestions to the cupcake crawl originally - but they never responded. Big surprise."

The cafe is actually a room on the lower level of the Elephant and Castle bar and restaurant (they also have Karaoke). When we first walked into the room, the majority of the people there seemed to be half - or even less than half our age. It's a fairly large, square room set up with large rectangular tables for 10. We ended up sitting with a family of four - parents and two teenage daughters. We were greeted by some of the characters in the play and escorted to our tables. Since we arrived a bit late, the people sitting at our table had already been in the process of eating their salads. A few minutes later, we received our cesar salads and the ""play"" began. The actors are literally in your midst as they act out ""Who Killed the Boss"". They actively interact with the audience and move around the room so they can engage all the diners. The ""play"" reaches it's climax (the murder of the boss), at which point there's an intermission where the actors become the waiters and bring out the entrees. You have to choose your entrees a couple of days before attending - three options were available - pasta, chicken or steak ($5 extra for steak). We all chose the chicken and it was surprisingly good - very nicely seasoned and served with a baked potato and green beans. After the dinner plates were removed, each person was handed a sheet where you are asked to give your best guess as to who killed the boss. Following dessert (Boston Cream Pie was served), they pick the best/funniest ones and read them outloud to the audience. Then, the play resumes and we find out who actually did ""kill the boss"". By the way, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages are served at a cash bar.

I prefaced this by saying that we went in with no expectations and in fact, had a surprisingly good time. Was it a tad hokey - probably. Nonetheless, if you keep an open mind and don't take yourself too seriously, you can have a fun time with friends and family."

http://www.bostonchocolatetours.com/tours/

Let me start by saying that the tour guide and the company are very nice. I wanted so badly to like this tour but unfortunatley the places you visit, the amenitites and the price do not line up. Our first stop was at Hotel Chocolat on Newbury Street where the tour begins. You are warmly greeted and given the details of how the tour will work. They supply you with a small brown paper shopping bag which at first seemed like we would need it to fill it with all of our treats. That never really happened.
After the manager of Hotel Chocolat provides an overview of where chocolate comes from they provide 2 samples of their chocolate which were our favorite on the entire tour. We went back and bought some. After, we were brought outside where our tour guide delivered us mini cupcakes from DC Cupcakes which were very good but we all took from the box and ate them on the side walk. There were extras left that you could take but the plastic bag they provide is not practical to do so. Some of the other people took some but I was really hoping for small individual boxes with the two that was for us. Instead it's a free for all and if you don't want to mash up a cupcake into a plastic bag then you do not get your share.
The next step was Ben & Jerry's. We found the stop very informative and the ice cream is delicious but everyone had been to a Ben & Jerry's (I think most people have). We received one scoop of ice cream.
After ice cream, we went to Teuscher Chocolate. We were excited to go here as it appeared to be a true choclatier. Upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly, informed of who the company was and provide one small sample of their champagne truffle. That was it...no showing of how they make them, no additiional tasting but plenty of time to ""shop"". We felt a bit odd as it felt like we were brought it to shop versus a real tasting.

The next stop Sweet Cupcake where the staff of the shop never even came over. We were provided our second double chocolate mini cupcake which to be honest most of us ate one bite and threw out the rest. There really wasn't a need for another cupcake and the stop seemed disjointed. Next we visited a candy shop. The store was packed with a bunch of options and we sampled about four offerings. Again, it was a store with samples and then you could look around to shop. The last stop was a chocolate store in Copley that was very tiny and we had a few samples there.

As I look back at the email it described the tour as the opportunity to learn about chocolate, visit chocolatiers, the expense was explained because we would be visiting shops with the highest quality chocolate. When I add it all up: 2 mini cupacakes, 1 small champagne truffle, 1 scoop of ice cream and various small samples I just don't know if the $48 is worth it. The other tours in different neighborhoods may be better but we didn't really learn a ton and left with very limited samples of chocolate.

My suggestion is to offer more amenities to make it worthwhile. A bottle of water, appropriate containers, more sample to take home and remove places that are gift shops and focus more on true chocolate shops. I think having the cupcake and ice cream was a nice touch and maybe showcasing the variety of chocolate with samples that include coconut, caramel etc would be nice too. It would also break up the tasting a bit more too."

This will give people a bad impression of the lovely, fascinating city of Boston - rich in history and lore. What you get here is a painfully boring, shamefully repetitive, and generic walking tour. There were a few points at which I felt a little interested (and maybe my perspective is skewed because I'm local and familiar with the main events of the city's history), but 99% of the tour was things like ""so there's the State House"", or ""over there is the local FBI office."" In other words, a lot of stops where I, and I think all my tour-mates asked (to ourselves), ""why is this interesting?"" The guide correctly identified various structures as we briefly walked by them. OK, fine. Don't expect much ghost talk on this because there mostly isn't any. At best you get, ""People say that they see a ghost in that building, but no one really knows."" But then there were unforgivable errors. Errors in fact and gross errors in tour management. Number one error: repetition. Our guide repeated his stories multiple times as we went by the same sites via different streets. Second, bad story telling. Bland, dispassionate delivery. The guide typically spoke (monotone) while walking at a too-fast pace and facing away from the group (in front). Perhaps just as bad, factual errors...not so much about local history as with pop culture references and tie-ins about which the guide knew nothing about (ex. about H. P. Lovecraft or the films of Daniel Radcliffe...no, ""The Woman in Black"" is not the most recent Harry Potter film). Then there's good old-fashioned unprofessionalism. Checking your smart phone every chance you get? Please don't. Leading people into the busy streets of Boston in dangerous traffic through ""don't walk"" lights? Don't do it. Every Bostonian knows that sometimes jaywalking is safe and perfectly efficient, but we made some really appalling dives into traffic. God help you if you're in the back of the group or aren't accustomed to dashing in front of cars quickly.

Anyway, I could rant on but I'm probably starting to bore you as much as this tour. Bottom line: not fun, barely informative, factually dubious, poorly guided. Whether you're local or visiting from elsewhere, you're better off spending your money on just about anything else. There's lots of great stuff to do by day and by night. Don't waste your time with this unfortunate dud."

Fun experience, fairly good food, and lots of laughs. Criticism is about the venue/seating. If you weren't in just the right place, you missed a lot or had a very sore neck. It really felt like they were trying to squeeze too many people into one area. But otherwise, I would recommend this to others.

They were all pretty generic (mostly chocolate, vanilla with different icings) and I was looking to try some of the more exotic flavors. Having said that, I would recommend this tour as an excuse to walk around Boston to find out where these shops are and get a good walk around the heart of the city. I liked it because it was very informal and you could purchase things at each shop. I didn't find the tour guides particularly knowledgable or personable, but again, they take you through the city and feed you cupcakes so I was happy! Bring your own water and a flat bottom reusable shopping bag to store your extra cupcakes, the bags they give you are not adequate and force you to store your extra cupcakes sideways."

Our tour guide was India and she was very good. Friendly, knowledgeable, kept a good pace. She did a great job and we had a parade to deal with that was a bit of a monkey wrench but she handled it all quite well.

Isabelle's Curly Cakes was the hands down winner. There wasn't even a close second. He cupcakes are really really delicious. We headed back there to buy some other flavors after the tour ended!

Biggest disappointment was Georgetown Cupcakes. I had heard so much about them that I expected something better than dry cake and over-powering frosting.

The tour gives out a plastic cupcake holder and bag for carrying anything you can't or don't want to eat, which was really thoughtful of them. There's one little problem. The cupcake holder doesn't fit in the bag so that the cupcakes can stay upright. You have to put it in on its side and then if you use the nice carrying handles of the bag your cupcakes are sideways. This was one reason why I chose to just eat everything as we got it. This is a simple fix for them. It really wasn't an overwhelming amount of food. Most of the cupcakes were minis.

Over all this was a very pleasant tour and a nice walk with some good cupcakes."

It seems like the line up of places that provide the cupcakes change a bit so you may or may not go where you're hoping. Our tour's first stop was Isabelle's Curly cakes, this was a good cupcake and clearly the best cupcake of the tour. Next we stopped at Cafe Vanille where we got cupcakes that were cut in half and had a strange purple colored cake, it was a sponge cake that while moist didn't offer much in the way of flavor. Our next stop was Finale, this cupcake tasted good but had a strange hardshell top that was, well strange! Our next stop was Georgetown cupcakes, here we got a chocolate mint cupcake that was not very good and easily forgotten.
Next up was Flour Bakery where we had a very good chocolate cupcake, probaby the second place winner of the day. Sweet was our next stop and the cupcake offering there was okay but nothing spectacular. We then stopped in at Robin's candy where we were offered probably five or six different samples of their confections, everything was quite good and the store is charming. Next was a Tee-shirt shop called Johnny Cupcakes, this stop was sved by the fact that they had cupcakes from JannaBee's for us to sample and these were very good, probably tied for second place of the day. Our final stop was coldstone creamery for an Ice cream cupcake which is a nice way to end the tour. I wish we would have had the chance to sample something from Kickass but they were not on the tour the day we attended.
Notes about the tour:
The tour company gives you a bag and a plastic cupcake holder but the bag isn't large enough to hold the cupcake container horizontally so it gets kind of messy. Speaking of messy the Ice Cream cupcake can be very messy. I would suggest bringing along a spoon and some wet ones for this tour.
You get half size cupcakes so I would estimate that you are eating about a good birthday cake size amount of cake during this tour so it's not like you have to lug all these cupcakes around with you back to your home or hotel.
Our tour guide was very personable and helpful. We had a tour with all adults so I think this helped out in making our day as drama free as possible.

For us there was very little competition here. Isabelles clearly had the best cupcakes with flour and JannaBee's running a distant second and third. If I had to rate further down I would give Finale fourth place, Sweet fifth place, and Georgetown sixth, coldstone is not really a cupcake so I didn't rate that one.
This was a fun morning/afternoon and a well run tour, I would surely checkout one of their other tours in the future."

I highly recommend it! So we decided to try the Great Cupcake Crawl. We enjoyed it, but we weren't quite as prepared for it as we would have liked to be. So if you're going, here are some tips.

-The tour is a wonderful way to see large parts of the city. That may have been my favorite part, as I don't know Boston well. We started in the wharf district and hit Boston Common and the Public Garden, Beacon Hill, Newbury Street, and spots along the way. This means, though, that there is a good amount of walking, and on a very hot day, some might find that difficult. (The Back Bay tour is considerably shorter and confined to Newbury Street.)

-Whereas the Back Bay tour gives you small samples at each stop, this one gives whole cupcakes! There was no way I could eat that much, even though I have a deep and abiding love for pastry. The tour provided a plastic cupcake holder for leftovers, but it was not large enough for everything. So you might want to think about bringing an extra holder, and maybe a fork if you just want a bite of each cake.

I would have preferred bite-sized samples of the cupcakes, I think, rather than whole ones. If they did it that way, the tour could either build in the cost of a whole one at each stop for participants to enjoy later, or they could reduce the price a bit and give us time to buy some to go, as we did on the Back Bay one.

-The tour provided a small paper bag, but it was smaller than the cupcake holder. As a result, we had to carry the bag sideways, and everyone I saw dropped the bag or the holder at least once, resulting in smashed cupcakes. It's not that they weren't still delicious, but that it was impossible to tell which one you were eating once you got home. I'd recommend that you bring one of those grocery store-type tote bags instead. That will allow the holder to lay flat, and allow room for your purchases!

-Bring water. Some places can refill a water bottle, but most of them don't have a water fountain.

-Remember to tip the guide! They work hard and try to make sure everyone enjoys themselves.

I didn't find this one as informative about the product as the Back Bay one. Only one of the shops tried to tell us a little about what ingredients they used, for instance. I would have enjoyed learning more about each shop, why they decided to do cupcakes, how they choose ingredients and flavors, and so forth,

We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this tour. Come hungry!"

We have yet to top that one. Since then, inspired by that tour, we have taken ghost tours both in U.S. cities and abroad. Last Thursday night, we did the Boston Ghost & Legends Tour. It was the worst one we've been on, anywhere. Apparently, the regular guide did not show, although the man who gave the tour never admitted that. Contrary to an email we received instructing us to meet our guide with a sign and a yellow jacket, our guide had no sign, no jacket, no lanterns, and no ability. When we asked why there were no lanterns, he told us dismissively that they didn't have them that night (no reason given) but that 'it was the same tour.' Dressed in a black business suit as if he'd just gotten off work, he introduced himself as ""Tom Finn""--what we assume was his attempt at a clever combination of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. That was the only thing ""clever"" about the tour. Apart from the name and title of the tour, there was no introduction, very little in the way of stories--more like a poorly researched historical tour (not much more information that we found in our AAA guide), no small talk, and no attempt to connect with any of us. We were sometimes abruptly led right into busy streets against the light in traffic in the middle of the block. He didn't even return us to the starting location--leaving us at a busy intersection in front of the Holocaust memorial at 9:20. We started late, as well. Hardly a 90-minute tour. Half the time, ""Tom"" would start a story without waiting for everyone to arrive. Often, they'd just end abruptly. He was definitely not a 'story teller.' We picked this tour over the other well-known one because we thought it would be classier--no people jumping out from behind tombstones--and we wanted to walk, not ride. We called first to book the tour and were told they couldn't take our credit card right then, but they would call us back in 10 minutes. They didn't. We tried calling back--no answer. We went online and booked but we were not able to get the lower price quoted by phone. We arrived 15 minutes early as requested, but couldn't find the tour. We called and were given very poor directions. Then, when we called again, it went to voice mail, leaving us to wonder if we'd been had. Once we found the group, the guide asked if everyone had eaten and whether anyone wanted to get something to drink before we left. We were all so shocked at the behavior, no one responded. We really don't believe that the guide was a ""regular,"" but if he was, then there's no hope for this tour at all. It was simply terrible. What the company should have done was simply cancel and give us all our money back. The Guide kept checking his phone--at first, I thought he was expecting a call or chatting with someone. In retrospect, I wonder if someone may have been texting him about what to do next. I have rarely given ""terrible"" reviews, but this tour warrants it. Skip it; take the one in Plymouth, if you can."

Boats - the main boats are the rhodes 19, which have ample space for 4 adults. They also have some cruising boats, J22s and lasers. The condition of the boats could be better but they are certainly functional and extremely seaworthy. In fact, they are getting new sails for the 2012 season
Boat availability - They always have something available. There have only been 2 times where it was questionable of when I would have a boat and the most I've waited was 2 minutes.
Experience - Sailing in Boston Harbor is a lot of fun. There's a lot going on - ferries, tankers, state police, coast guard, races - you are among the professionals, but it is still manageable.

Bottom line is that it was fun, our guide was friendly, and we tried some things we wouldn't have tried otherwise, but the value was questionable. Our tour guide talked to us about the science and culinary history of chocolate, which was good, but she didn't have much to say about the South End as were walking around. We learned more about the neighborhood from one shop owner who had been there for decades and took 10-20 minutes to talk to our group. I'll echo other reviewers who said you could probably do better walking around by yourself with a map, a list of shops, and $100 (which buys a lot of chocolate)."
wishingiwasonvaca,Medford,Massachusetts,,,"['boston', ' ma', 'salem', ' ma', 'sharon', ' ma']",[' usa'],[],"Boston Chocolate Tours, Boston",N/A,,2 of 5 stars,"QUICK ADVICE (in case you don't read any further, I admit I had a LOT to say): Get a group of friends together, grab a few forks, and walk around the North End ordering any chocolate delicacies that pop out to you! You'll be able to do it for a FRACTION of the price, and you might actually eat something that tastes more unique than an Entenmanns chocolate cake!

THE LONG VERSION: I can't believe I paid almost $50 for this Tour!! We did the Faneuil Hall/North End tour and it was far more comical than it was delicious. Thank goodness I went with some friends who have a good sense of humor, because at least we got a silly memory out of the experience.

It seems that having chocolate (good or bad) on the menu was the only criteria when selecting a stop for this tour. The desserts we had were so generic and sub-par that by the end we were expecting to be taken to Burger King for a chocolate shake or a vending machine for a Kit Kat. I am actually capable of buying my own mediocre chocolate chip cookie without the aid of a tour guide. I assumed the tour would be full of hidden treasures, unique tastes, chocolate insights, and out-of-this-world options. Boy was I wrong!

One of the more absurd stops was the hospital-food-chocolate-cake at Wagamama (a noodle bar). Every restaurant under the sun throws a dessert or two on their menu, and apparently that was good enough for this tour company. The least of their problems was that they kept calling it a 5 layer cake when it was 3 (I'm no baker, but even I know that the frosting does not count as a layer).

Another ""highlight"" was eating a cannoli while standing beneath a leaky air conditioner in a dirty ally across from Mike's Pastry. While a Mike's cannoli is delicious - this wasn't even chocolate!! - and its flavor was far out shadowed by how difficult (and gross) it was to eat standing on the sidewalk while annoyed pedestrians tried to push past us.

Our tour guide talked about how full she was at every stop and refused to eat anything. Her banter with the vendors over how she couldn't eat another bite was comical - because she didn't eat anything! Shouldn't a chocolate tour guide like to eat chocolate? Additionally, her explanation of the creation of chocolate was filled with inaccuracies, mispronunciations and awkward incorrect factoids. She'd clearly memorized a script (and not well!) Her knowledge base was limited to what others had told her, but she had no experiences of her own. After telling us how amazing the chocolate cream pie was at the Omni Parker House she confessed she'd ""only used their bathroom"" and never eaten there.

While Godiva - our first stop - is always yummy, it came at a price. The only way to get our one free truffle (that excluded about a dozen things) was to join their membership club and hand over our e-mail address. I would assume that the $50 price tag on the tour would at save me from a shameful sales pitch. But, nope.

I also incorrectly assumed this tour would include some variety. The online description had mentioned things like gelato - but there was none of that on our tour. It was all generic baked goods. Some gelato, hot chocolate, Sam Adams chocolate beer, or a chocolate-covered-SOMETHING would have added some nice variety.

Also, why was water so insanely hard to come by on this tour? Tap water is free at every location we went to, but it was apparently off limits to us. While we were told to bring our own bottle, that goes pretty quickly on an 85 degree day. Our tour guide kept promising to get us water at the next stop, but was so timid that she didn't even have the courage to flag down the water at Cheers. We ended up going to the bar to get our own. Tour guides should be outgoing and dynamic, not fearful of asking for a glass of water. (And don't get me started again on the not-eating-chocolate part ...).

The portions were smaller than the samples you get at Whole Foods. We could have just as easily popped into Maria's and asked for a taste (less than one square inch is what we got) of a dessert (that again - didn't have an ounce of chocolate in it!!!) ... and that would have been free!

This tour company has an awesome idea, but they have a LOT more work to do if they want to charge anything more than a few bucks for something like this. It felt more like a PR opportunity for the bakeries we visited, and not like an insightful chocolate tour. BUMMER!"

Our guide, Victoria, was knowledgeable, charming and funny. Not only did she give us the history of each store we visited, but she interjected facts about chocolate all during the tour (she even had props!).
While I am from Boston, I was unfamiliar with the South End and this tour not only introduced me to a wonderful array of restaurants and shops in the area, but it opened my eyes to a part of the city that I had never been to.
There were about a dozen people on the tour and Victoria helped us get acquainted and comfortable with her and each other from the start.
The culinary selection was out of this world from truffles and brownies to ice cream and beverages.

Never been on a Boston boat tour and I love fast speeds, so I thought this would be perfect for my wife and I to try. Jumped on to the inflatable raft which held 2 other couples plus Captain Susan, took a seat, HELD ON to the handrail, and we were ready to begin. As we pull out of the no wake zone steering in between the docked sailboats, you could tell that Captain Susan was kind of gaugeing us to determine how fast she was going to be able to go when the time came. About 10 minutes into the trip, we were located enough distance from everyone to start going fast. What a thrilling an exciting speed ride it is. Splashing and bumping thru the waves, it felt like the boat was flying thru the air when we hit just the right wave. Not to slow and not too fast my liking, the minute or so fast speed ride ended too quickly as we approached the next landmark of the tour. That's pretty much how the next 75 minutes were. We visited Spectacle Island, Castle Island, Shutter Island and a few other places along the way, mixed in with periods of high speed travel. Susan was very knowledgeable and friendly. She seemed extremely proud of herself when she did doughnuts at high speed in the water. Overall, just alot of fun on this hot day. and everything I saw on the tour was pretty much new to me. My wife enjoyed it as well. Her knuckles were white for about 30 minutes after the tour becuase she had been holding on so tight to the hand rail. I would definitely do this again with or without family from out of town, but I wonder how many people are going to pay the $110 for the hour. I think at $45, this was a bargain and an absolute must do."

""]","Hubway Bike Rental, Boston",N/A,,3 of 5 stars,"I think this talk about Boston becoming a bike-friendly city does not apply to the BackBay area. We rode from the Prudential Center to the Aquarium and really took our lives into our hands. The bike lanes are also the bus lanes, but cars drive in them too. I had less than 12"" between me and moving cars.

The next day, we rode from Prudential Center to the Museum of Science. That was easier as far as car traffic, but the big problem was we couldn't find the Hubway bike racks, and the parking garage guy didn't know where they were and directed us the wrong direction. Turned out they were 2 blocks from the museum.

So if you decide to risk this, here are 3 additional key pieces of advice:

1. Know exactly where the Hubway bike racks are located for every stop you are going to. There are no street signs anywhere to direct you to the racks. In the case of the aquarium, they were along a separate building unrelated to the aquarium.

2. Know exactly how you are going to get there. You should trace the route on google maps and know landmarks. I didn't do this and couldn't locate the pedestrian bridge to walk over Hwy 28 to get to the Charles River. it's really hard to do this when you're on the bike. There are no street signs to direct you to these things or the landmarks, etc.

3. Take a cell phone and hope you have coverage everywhere.

Other than that, the rates are reasonable, and the Hubway machines worked well. I tried calling customer service when looking for the science museum racks, but they were a 5' wait for a rep, who then hung up on me. Our hotel provided helmets, which I guess are required or you may get a ticket. All in all, it was kind of a stressful experience and my buddy was quite unhappy with me. Ouch!"

The tour starts at the intersection of Tremont and Park street and follows through Boston Commons to Mass state house and to several residential streets on Beacon hill including privately owned Acorn st. The guide stopped several times in the Commons, next to the Mass state house and on several Beacon hill streets providing historical commentary regarding the area, such as story of General hooker statute next to Mass state house, or story of Boston strangler. It is a relatively long tour that goes on for 90 minutes but it goes by very fast. The only thing I wish they would give an option to cancel a tour without penalty in case of inclement weather, especially considering how fast it changes in Boston, it is not always possible to know whether it would be raining in advance. We used the groupon for the tour, and I think it was a great value.

A friend of mine had mentioned the tour a week prior. I was surprised it was not sold out. I'm told that around 100 people sail at a time and the schooner goes out 3-4 times a day.

First impression: The Schooner was well cared for. Although we sailed at 8:30 pm, and at times it was hard to see, the decks were clean and everything was painted nicely. The sails and hardware were in excellent shape.

The staff was very friendly. In particular the main man (dressed in colonial attire) obviously made the trip enjoyable. He was very quick witted and sharp tongued. He sang sea shanties along with his concertina and banjo. It was a fantastic night out. When we docked back into the port, he also played the Great Highland Bagpipes.

While on board, several guests helped raise the sails after leaving the harbor. I was surprised at how much work goes into sailing a ship. I think my arms still hurt from all the pulling.

Cons: The area where the colonial man had his sing a long was in the rear of the ship. The area was a bit small for everyone on board. Once he started giving the history of Rum and sailors, everyone on board came over to him. The area was crowded. It should be noted the area also housed the bar. For people sitting on the deck boxes, their view was often obstructed by people waiting for the bar.

Also, when booking I would have liked the option to pre buy more drinks. It only allowed you to buy one per person on the reservation. Lets be honest, who is going on a rum cruise and only having one drink? No one said the masses!!

All in all it was a good time and worth the money. It was a very relaxing 2 hours tour filled with rum and laughter."

For this amount of money good food is expected. As described in other reviews on this site, the dinner was served before the boat even left the dock probably so they can get the eating out of the way and have more time to keep selling drinks. That is what this cruise is all about. It is a 3 hour booze cruise with some food and a DJ. Their website states that the Sunday dinner cruise menu includes a salad, roast, mashed potato, grilled chicken, tilapia, salmon, pasta, rice, vegetable, and a vegetable medley in addition to rolls and butter. I even asked the person at the ticket window at the dock what was on the menu this night and she said to look at the sign on the wall with the buffet listing which listed all of the above. The buffet this evening did not include tilapia, salmon, rice, or the vegetable medley. The choice was mushy pasta or dry chicken, mashed potato, green beans, salad, and meat. Since we love seafood and don't eat red meat, our choice was limited. The pasta and chicken must have been prepared earlier in the day. Other reviews have described how poor the deserts were.

The others were disengaging; they couldn't be bothered to greet a guest, let alone ask if they could help them. My fiance took a cruise while we were there and it was much the same, very few staff members seemed happy to be there with the clients. As others have said, the linens aren't up to B&B standards either. This is a hostel with all the same characters, oddities, and cut corners you would expect from budget accommodations being run by college kids.

During the cruise (and any other ones they took after they put our bags on board), our cabin was unlocked and at the beginning of the sail the captain invited the passengers to take a look around in any of the open doors (the crew sleeps on board and keeps their doors closed) so anyone could have gone through our things at will. The crew seem like 0well meaning young folks but the cruise was a party for them as much more the guests (an old crew member was visiting, someone was having a last sail, etc), which made me just a bit uneasy; our safety was in their hands after all.

As for communication, we did not know until we arrived in on Friday that on Saturday we could not return to our room until 10:30.

Not an inexpensive experience, I was anxious about the impending forecast of rain, but was pleased to see that the lovely boat can accommodate inclement weather because almost all the dining tables have full window views.

I was more than a little disappointed then to learn, as we were seated at one of only two tables on our deck WITHOUT a window view, that window seating is only guaranteed to those who pay to ensure it... I seem to have missed that on the online reservation form.

However, when I expressed my frustration to the ship's seating manager (I'm so disappointed that I did not get his name), he said he would try to re-seat us if anyone didn't show up...Resigned to a waste of money, I went to the upper deck to take in the admittedly awesome view, and was amazed to learn from my kids, when I came back to our deck, that we had been re-seated - with a beautiful window table. I offered to pay for the re-seating, and the generous manager merely wished me a Happy 4th of July, with a genuine smile.

Although there was a bit of petulant rain here and there during the cruise, we were lucky that it held off while we followed the USS Constitution on its turnabout tour - especially during the mock canon volley with another ship. This was an experience you will hopefully love and never forget.

Between the lobster luncheon, very adequate considering there were several hundred people to serve, the excitement of being on the Boston Harbor on the 4th of July, and the attentive service of the maitre de and his staff, we would highly recommend this experience for others in the future.

I'd like to make a special note of appreciation to a young woman from Union college who is working in the area, whom I observed exercising the most extraordinary care of an older passenger who had extreme reservation about navigating the stairs to her assigned deck. I was so impressed with the young woman's courtesy, respect, and care for this guest that it merits recognizing - either outstanding training from her management, family, or both.

What we got was a ship where people had to participate with hoisting the sail into position, and had to sit on the ship wherever they could sit -- no formal seating was provided. And there was no narration of what we were viewing in the harbor, just sailing around the harbor in a tall sail ship. Also, no one had mentioned that people could bring all kinds of food on board and eat in front of other people. Someone there had basically a picnic lunch. This was a 12:00 sailing.

After that we went into and the dinner started. The buffet was not exactly big, the pasta will not get a comment (I am a picky italian, I admit it), the fish was not good but the ribs were worth it.
The problem I've got is with the cruise itself. Was short, the ""sunset"" was seen but before the opportunity to make some good photos we were already back and gone.
What I would say is that this particular service is not entirely recommended, but still theres room to enjoy it. Just not by myself.

Dr. Alex Goldfeld was a very personable guide who had the expertise to factually answer any question that came up within our group of seven guests.

During a wonderful, fact-filled trip through Boston's North End, Dr. Goldfeld's expertise perhaps shone through best inside the Old North Church/Christ Church and at Copp's Hill Burying Ground, where he shared his knowledge from heritage and his studies to reveal things that no other casual visitors walked away knowing. At the Old North Church, Dr. Goldfeld explained far more than the docent at the lectern, as part of the price of admission, was able to tell us.

Dr. Goldfeld ably addressed the history and evolution of Boston's North End from its original English inhabitants through the Irish influx and its current role as the Little Italy of Boston, a late heritage that has lasted for the past 100 years.

Personal Magic for Me: Were it not for Dr. Goldfeld's tour, I would have not discovered the Green Dragon Tavern. The oft-written-about Union Oyster House will serve you six shucked oysters for an outrageous $16. Right around the corner, an immediate right turn down the next alley, beckons the Green Dragon Tavern, which also boasts as a place where the Sons of Liberty met. Having a meal in a place where the Sons of LIberty met was an item on my bucket list. Nearly as cool, an entire lobster dinner at the Green Dragon Tavern was only $13.50 with two sides. Adding a gin and tonic, the total tab was around $20... remarkable for a Boston experience.

I look forward to enjoying a Context Tour during future stays in major cities around the world. My next adventure may be in Washington, D.C. where there are three or four possible walking tours available."

Cara, the founder and tour guide, is a long time fan and has an interesting and fun history with the group. We met her at the Shawmut T Station, and along with another fan and friend of Cara's, started our tour with a surprise 'guest' tour guide [sorry - can't say who, but it wasn't one of the New Kids.] Normally I believe it is a walking tour, with maybe a ride on the T, but that day we got to go by car. We visited the former homes of Jon and Jordan Knight, Danny Wood and Donnie Wahlberg [Joey McIntyre grew up in Jamaica Plain - that is another tour you can take]. Also viewed were All Saints Church, Lee Elementary School, Hi Fi Pizza and DYC. Since we were driven around, we got a nice overview of the very diverse Dorchester neighborhood, an interesting 'extra'!
Cara, as a long-time fan, has a lot of knowledge of the band's history and some fun stories and anecdotes. She is a very upbeat, pleasant woman, who, though not a Boston native, has a great love and knowledge of her adopted city.
As a more recent fan of NKOTB, I don't have the extensive knowledge the long-time fans have, so a lot of what Cara shared was new info for us. If you have been a fan from the start, you may have the info, but nothing beats seeing these places in person. I highly recommend taking the tour if you are going to be in Boston.

Where ever we go we always take a bus or trolley tour of the city. This is a hop off and on tour. The drivers were all polite, but their facts were a little off. We did think it was worth the money.

We were also informed that their tours stopped at 4:30 PM. We took a complete loop around Boston on Monday and made notes of which stops were wanted to go back to on Tuesday for more detailed stops. On Tuesday, we got off at Fenway Park first where we walked around the outside of the park, all the while staying within viewing distance of the trolley stop. We spent about 20 minutes there and returned to the trolley stop only to wait some 30 to 45 minutes for a trolley to finally show up. While we waited, we counted six Old Town Trolleys stop at the same location. After we finally got a ride to continue our tour of Boston, we later got off at the Navy Yard to tour the USS Constitution. As we exited the trolley at 3 PM, the driver made no mention of end of the day trolley runs. We toured the Constitution and the museum and returned to the trolley stop at 4:10. Again, a long extended wait for a trolley while noticing a dozen or so Old Town Trolleys plus numerous other trolley companies stopping at the Navy Yard. Finally, after waiting some 45 minutes, we called the phone number of the Beantown Trolley receipt only to be informed after a 15 minute wait that their company stops running at 4 PM on Tuesdays. Funny, the ticket agent and the driver both failed to mention this. I will give credit where credit is due; Beantown Trolleys did send a driver back out to pick us up and to return us to our hotel. This is the reason they get a rating of two instead of one. I have used Old Town Trolley at Savannah and Washington, DC and observed that they run a much better operation in Boston than does Beantown Trolley. My recommendation is to avoid Beantown Trolley at all costs."

Had 12 minute walk to pickup point at Wyndhams Hotel. Then organisation begins to fall apart - pickup bus is 30 minutes late and then takes us to booking office in the middle of Boston where we had to queue for tickets which we already held having been printed for us by the efficient receptionist at Onyx. Having queued the lady looked at our voucher and directed us to the first coach in the queue in the street outside. The coach may have been luxury when it was new but this one's best days were certainly behind it. The seats were threadbare and I noticed that at least two had deep slashes in them. The interior was not particularly clean and there was a black plastic bag tied to the toilet door for rubbish next to our seat. Due to the late pickup and having to queue for no apparent reason at the ticket office the coach was full and we had no choice of seats and had to sit at the back of the bus. We then sat on this full coach for a further 30+minutes before setting off. We were now well over an hour late of the published start time. NOT AN IMPRESSIVE BEGINNING TO THE DAY!

Aspects of the trip were good - the scenery was impressive and the boat trip was enjoyable. The visit to the Kennedy memorial and beach was the highlight - more time could have been given to this and less time to Sandwich and the glass factory. Whilst the food at the Lobster Boat was ok, it's location was in the middle of nowhere.

Quite simply, Cape Cod is well worth visiting but this company could learn a lot by sending representatives to Bruges in Belgium to see how Quasimodo organises its tours and the first class customer service it offers. Liked Cape Cod but the coach company's organisation left a lot to be desired! This was not American business efficiency at its best and could hardly be described as value for money. A pity because Cape Cod in the Fall should be seen."

witch0f0z,,,,,"['boston', ' ma']",[' usa'],[],"Brush Hill Tours / Gray Line Boston, Boston",N/A,,2 of 5 stars,"This tour does not achieve what is promised at the time of booking. And based on the other comments, this seems to be the norm, not an exception.
First of all, the booking system is confusing, as after the process ends on Viator one has to contact the tour provider and arrange all the details. This doesn't make sense - all tours that have pick up locations have a schedule and the pick up time can be confirmed at the time of booking.
Then the pickups are centralised at the depot, where buses are parked left, right and centre and everyone is running around trying to 'sign in'. If people already called to confirm details and have a valid voicher, why can't they just get on buses - the drivers should be able to check off names instead of just collecting vouchers.
Now the tour itself - we left about 45 minutes late. The driver talked non-stop, but the amount of useful information was very limited ( something about the Sagamore canal, some facts about the presidents, some info about buildings we passed by). Everything else was a discombobulated ramble about traffic, where we would have gone if we were on time (does that ever happen?) and bad jokes.
The first destination of the tour was tha restaurant. Which is not even in a place where one can skip and go stroll along the street. Then we rushed to take the bay cruise tour - nothing out of ordinary, just going out on the water to look at the Kennedy compound from the sea. A winded drive through houses described as expensive and a short stop at the Kennedy memorial. And then a rushed drive to the glass museum, where the demo ended just as we arrived and the guy there didn't take that into account. He was doing a swan just when we got in, but he broke it and didn't seem too interested or keen on showing the nice experience. The museum is a nice collection of glass objects. And is across the street from the old grist mills, which is advertised as a visiting spot but was not included.
I don't understand why the tour is offered in the fall, when almost all places are closed on Cape Cod - the driver kept telling us that. They surely know nothing is open, so how could one see or do more?"

It seemed that the criteria for where the bus stopped was dictated by the easiest place to park the bus. We travelled through delightfull cape cod residential and park areas, but where was the first stop after 2 hours travel? At a restaraunt on the outskirts of cape cod, with no other eating choices, no scenery, no walks, and absolutely nothing of interest. After over an hour at this dead end, we departed for the cruise on the bay - an absolute bore, where the highlight was a view of the kennedy compound from about 1km away, then back to dock. Then came the final insult to this day out - we were delivered to the run down main street shopping area of cape cod for nearly 1.5hrs, where the highlight was the tee shirt and icecream shop!!!!! after which a slogging 2hr trip back to boston.
I am amazed that some reviewers have given this 4 and 5 stars!!! Now im not saying that these people are brain dead, because this would be insulting, but if you have trouble tying your own shoe laces, and get really excited by a big feed at macdonalds, then this is the tour for you."

However, I recommend finding another way to visit these areas if you hope to spend any meaningful time there. This provides only very brief visits, but a long bus ride.

The driver provided some interesting information, but his political comments were not appreciated, and he completely lost my husband based on this. No matter your party affiliation; as a tour provider, one must be cautious to avoid offending anyone.

According to the website, the deal, the company's map, and all signage, the trolley operates from 9-4:30 and offers hop-on, hop-off service on a 105-minute tour to many different Boston attractions. We got on a trolley at 11:30 and were told that it would only be operating until 2pm and that if we got off, we would have to call the driver to find out how long we'd have to wait for him to pick us up again because he would soon be the only trolley operating. We also had to pick up the passengers from two other trolleys, leaving the one we were on as the only trolley left running for the day. This meant that there was no way that we could hop off and on and still have time to complete the tour, so we stayed on despite our original plan to hop off at a few places. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and we learned a lot about Boston, but he had to constantly pause to answer his cell phone (to give estimated pick up times to other passengers) and would then complain that he only had 2 passengers all day the previous Friday and on this day he had 100 and we were running him all over the place (though there was never more than 10 passengers on the trolley I was on, despite combining 3 trolleys into 1; plus the tour moved in the same direction no matter who called, so I don't see why it was a problem to be run ""all over the city"" as he claimed.) The trolley itself was looking a little ragged, there was paint chipping and the cover used to winterize the windows was ripped and wasn't clear enough to take photos through. And though one of the stops is named Cambridge/Harvard/MIT, you would have to get on a subway to see Harvard (the tour stop is a subway station.) The content of the tour was great, but the service was not as advertised. I'm glad I didn't pay full price. I'd rather pay more for another trolley tour and be able to hop on and off during the advertised time period, hopefully with more than one trolley running so there isn't a 105-minute wait between trolleys."
