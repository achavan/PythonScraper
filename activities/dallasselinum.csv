Never having been to a spa my mum (who probably paid far too much) thought it would be a lovely way to relax after the birth of my son.
We visited the Chafford Hundred ""spa"" yesterday. I wasn't expecting much and I still managed to be bitterly disappointed by the whole experience.
Where to start......
We arrived at 10am as we were booked in for early treatments. The staff were very pleasant on arrival. We paid the extra money for our massage upgrades and 3 each for robes which I thought is a blooming cheek given you would expect robes for a spa day. We were then quickly shown where to change as we had early appointments. We were booked in for extended full body massages which I have to say were wonderful. The treatment rooms were very relaxing and we really enjoyed our massages. The ladies who did our treatments were very nice and were about the only compliment I can pay to this venue.
We then went on to have a manicure (mum) and a pedicure (myself). I was expecting them to be short treatments but to say they were rushed was an understatement! It was a quick flick with a nail file (no cuticle work or exfoliation) a colour was then put on. Can't say that you could call them manicures or pedicures. There we went on to have a facial which to be fair we're very nice.
We then were told to enjoy the relaxation room. The relaxation room is 6 heated beds! It had a warm water in a vase that you can serve yourself in a very attractive costa coffee paper cup. Ummmmm yep thats the total delux spa experience that you get at this venue. More than 6 people and your all going to be fighting for a relax in this room that is so dim that you can't possibly read a book.
No problem I thought. I'll grab my kindle and go for a relax around by the pool and perhaps have a sauna and steam. You then have to haul yourself through reception to get back to the changing rooms to use said facilities. So we went through to the pool for a relax....Fat chance! This would have involved us laying on the cold tiled floor as this Delux day of pamper and relaxation venue has no loungers! So no chance of a lay by the pool then.
We then thought maybe we could have a jacuzzi but alas it was not only filled to the brim with people but apparently having a major problem with foam scum. I can't comment on the condition of the steam and sauna rooms as in order to enjoy these would have involved giving other people lap dances. Thus you see the problem with this gym trying to pass its self off as a spa.... It's full of paying members also trying to enjoy the limited facilities. To try and cram in extra guests is just a money making scheme to cream as much money in from a venue designed as a.... Gym! It's not a spa. If I offer to paint people nails and let them have a swim in my bath does that make my house a spa?
Now I hope that managers read this review and actually start to take notice of what we are all saying about these ""spa days"" I just want to scream trade descriptions. I always try to see the best in a situation and if people read my other reviews I rarely moan about places I have visited. Far from telling people to visit a bannatyne I feel compelled to warn them off! Needless to say we left after our treatments never to return. Poor show Bannatyne!"

But this spa was nothing like the Fairfield one. You are greeted on entry by the receptionist and asked to fill out forms which ask the same questions as those when you booked! You then wait around for a while till someone realises you are ready and would like to start your experience...You are then passed on to another member of staff who will give you robes and towels which you have to pay an additional fee (3) and are then shown around the facilities. I had bought 2 vouchers as there were three of us. 1 voucher as a 2 for 1 and the other was a single entry spa experience. All three had a 30 min spa experience included. But turns out that they were all different....the team weren't flexible enough to make them the same even if they were of equal value. They were also meant to be 30 min experiences...they started late and finished early. Very disappointing!
The cafe also messed up our orders which added to the pain.
The spa facilities are very poor. The sauna is not a sauna...it does not heat up at all and there is water everywhere.
The Steam room has a dirty floor and the indoor jacuzzi has so many chemicals in it your eyes just sting the whole time you are in there...We ended up using the outdoor jacuzzi for most of the time...But even that was filthy.
I will not be going to a bannatyne again after this experience unless it was to the Fairfield venue"

4) came out spa and staff arguing in reception.

Wrote in to bannatyne to say how a awful it was and was accused of lying. I'm sure if they check their cameras they can tell we were telling the truth.also given I was with my husband- we were both lying apparently.

No one knew this initially and I felt I was just waiting around for ages. Not really sure what I was supposed to be doing. The reception staff left me sitting before taking me on a quick tour. Felt they were white blah.

This is a tiny place but that can be perfect. The pool and jacuzzi area looked lovely but the changing rooms were freezing and plain horrible, the ones at my council run gym are better. And you need a padlock for your locker?
And I felt the staff were just a little blah.


The treatments I had were lovely, expert facial and lava shells massage. But I was due to have 115 mins of treatments and I definitely didn't have that amount. Was taken into the treatment room and was left to change for what was about like 20 mins. Mid way through my facial, the therapist left the room but not while I had the masque on which I found strange, again no explanation and was gone for ages. I then had the masque on and the therapist sat breathing over me. It didn't feel the most relaxing.

I found the booking procedure difficult as there are not many treatment rooms so lack of availability. I had initially booked for a different day which was cancelled at the last minute due to staff shortage. Considering this was not my fault, booking another appt was a nightmare and I did not find the staff to be very accommodating.

Wouldn't rush back to Westminster but would try another."

We were so disappointed by the whole experience. Feedback has been provided directly to the Spa with no response from the General Manager.

On arrival we were asked to take a seat, someone would collect us to give us a tour of the spa. Whilst we sat, waited, and watched 4 girls at reception chatting 20 minutes passed only stopped by us saying something. No apology. The waiting area is where you sit amongst all the other lesiure centre customers, shockingly they expect you to pay for a robe and slippers which is appalling and clearly just another cheap ploy to make money off you. We asked nicely if the therapists could come get us from the changing rooms as we weren't prepared to pay extra. Of course they didn't! I had to go out and find them.

The facilities are in serious need of updating. This is not a spa  its a leisure centre with some spa like facilities. The changing rooms are filthy, and there isnt anywhere to get changed out of view of everyone else. All of the tiles, lockers are chipped and the showers were awful  constantly having to push a button for water to slowly filter out. In the mens changing room the emergency sprinklers are rusted, and more importantly a tile that had cracked and fallen off the wall had been taped back on the wall.

The area around the pool was quite frankly a joke  the relaxing beds were not made up properly, the bed just thrown on the lounger with no magazines or refreshments anywhere. This is what every other spa in the country is doing so why not here? A facilities man walked all round the pool with his outdoor shoes on not bothering to cover them with the blue plastic covers available. I have never witnessed anything like it in any other spa. The jacquzi is absolutely disgusting - a thick grey line of hair all around it. How has this not been noticed and cleaned?!

There is nothing luxurious about this spa or your facilities and I strongly recommend management and staff do some mystery shopping around some other spas in London to see the difference in service. We arrived at 11.30 and left at 2.30pm which says it all."
AmyE1993,,,,,"['playa de las americas', 'london', 'salou', 'armutalan', 'tarragona']","[' spain', ' uk', ' turkey']",[],"The Bannatyne Spa, London",N/A,,3 of 5 stars,"We bought a wowcher voucher and all 4 of us girls got in for 80. As the other reviews suggest this is essentially a gym with basic spa facilities.

It was easy to access from the tube station, just a 10 minute walk away. Once inside we completed a quick survey and was told to help ourselves to complimentary tea and coffee. After we completed our health style questions we were given a very quick tour of changing rooms, pool area and treatment room. Changing rooms are a tad dated and like I have already mentioned it is essentially a gym so they are quite basic gym changing facilities. Could not complain about cleanliness of any part of the gym/spa. It was a very relaxing day, our treatments were great and the woman who gave the treatments was lovely and welcoming. The poolside has 5 loungers so you need to claim these quite quickly and it is not an adult only environment so please be aware that children will be in the pool which they were when we went. You cannot get any kind of signal apart from slightly in the reception area. You can hire a dressing gown, slippers and towel from reception for a fee of 3 and you can keep your slippers and take them home with you. To lock the lockers you should be aware you are expected to bring your own padlock however if you don't have one you can sign for one at reception. I enjoyed my day with the girls at the spa but if you are looking for total relaxation I would perhaps spend a little extra on somewhere else. Would not say the spa is as bad as these recent reviews make out though."

Took time to find a slot to be booked in but we got there in the end.
Reception ladies were helpful and we paid for our upgrade to add a massage to the facial and hand in our three forms, including medical information.
I thought I had paid a deposit a robe and slippers for 3 but it was nonrefundable.
We went for tea in a very soulless canteen type area. It was quite grubby and it took about 10 mins to get a tea and coffee. The lady in the kitchen was very nice but perhaps could do with some more staff in there. It was expensive - a jacket potato cost 5, as did a panini.
We went for our facials and were called in. Mine was very pleasant but it was different to my friends who had a bit of a massage thrown in as well. There seemed to be confusion over rooms, who was supposed to go where and for what. We returned for massages and asked the usual anything medical question and my friend confirmed that as she had put on the form she had had a recent op. The therapist advised she wouldn't be able to have the massage and shouldn't have had the facial either. My friend was offered a pedicure but this was actually just a quick polish. My massage ended up being just 20mins, not 30. It was an odd massage too, I think the therapist used her elbows and then I had the feeling she was on her phone during a bit of it.
This really felt like more of a leisure facility than a day spa, where the therapists seemed to be keeping to a very strict schedule."

The trip had been bought as a christmas present and due to work commitments it took us a few months to book in so as you can imagine we were very much looking forward to it.

Upon arrival it doesn't really look like much, poorly sign posted most people end up going through the main entrance to be greeted by a grumpy receptionist of the offices above who hastily points you back downstairs. The spa itself is set in the basement of a posh office block and my initial impressions weren't great. It's dated and dull which surprised me taking into account Duncan Ballantyne proudly puts his name to it. After filling in our lengthy and intrusive questionnaire we sat in the reception area which doubles up as the relaxation room. There are no lunch facilities except in the office block upstairs (great to stroll around in whilst wearing a robe).

The steam room was out of order the day we visited. Nothing was offered as an apology, no complimentary drink or offer to return another day to use the steam room. The ladies changing room was quite frankly horrifying. Cold, dirty, old and dangerous, several plug sockets hanging off the wall around the vanity area. The pool is cramped with only 5 loungers, plus you can't relax as the banging from the steam room works are loud and irritating and builders traipse through the area constantly.

It's fair to note the facial I had was lovely but otherwise this entire day was awful, disappointing and frankly quite embarrassing. It doesn't take much to make a spa day successful, enjoyable and relaxing but the bannatyne group clearly don't care much for that in this tired old health club that is parading itself as a luxury spa.

From reading the other reviews on here we're clearly not the only people who has a bad time. let's hope bannatyne himself is business savvy enough to take note of customer feedback and reassess his mill bank branch."

We arrived at reception and filled in our health questionnaire, had a complimentary drink and waited to be shown the facilities.
We were shown the pool, sauna and jacuzzi, and changing rooms and that was it!!! No relaxing chill out room or quiet areas, plunge pools.... It most definitely isn't a spa, it's a gym that is trying to make extra money by mis selling itself.

The changing rooms - absolutely filthy, dust so thick on the toilet roll dispenser I could have written my name in it. Showers kept turning themselves off during use, must have had to hit the button about 15 times, so frustrating. The grill was full of hair as well! Yuck! One of the hair dryers leads was so short I would have had to sit on the floor to dry my hair, or be 2 foot tall, I went to reception with wet hair to get a replacement the general manager then produced a hair dryer without a plug that he was rewiring!! He couldn't do it, so asked a member of staff to get me a brand new one! Also, in the mirror area a plug socket was hanging off the wall.

The pool only had 5 loungers around it, and the one I had felt like the bottom was hanging out of it, really worn and old cushions too.

The steam room was out of action on our visit due to refurbishment, which meant that workman were walking backwards and forwards all day, then they started banging and bashing which was not relaxing at all.

The reception area where you wait for your treatments was cold and noisy and you can only get food by ordering down from the cafe which is situated upstairs in an office environment, so if you want food you either sit with the suits in your dressing gown or get food sent down which is not great, as you get plastic cutlery and have to eat at a fairly low table.

My treatment was short by 10 mins, which I only realised after I left the room, and my lady was no where to be seen! However, to be fair it was a nice massage! Although, as someone else said there isn't too many frills attached, I would expect little extras such as massage finishing off with oil on arms and feet, or maybe I have been spoilt.

I don't usually write reviews but this place was horrible, and I will be writing a complaint letter to Head office, although it really don't want a return visit, I just want to express my disgust.

DONT GO IS MY ADVICE!!"

The loungers around the pool are shabby and stained and there were only 4 of them.
The staff are nice enough and my massage was well executed but missing the little extras that usually accompany the massages I have at other spas e.g you are asked to select which oil you prefer or which areas you would like to focus on. The masseuse had freezing cold hands, the music was too loud and lights were too bright.
Website is misleading as those pictures look nothing like the facilities. Would not recommend and would not use again. If you are looking for a relaxing retreat in well maintained, up to date surroundings...look elsewhere."

After the usual palava over printing voucher codes and form-filling, we were given a tour and i paid the extra 3 each for robes and unlimited towels. The customer service wasn't great but they were friendly enough.
The reception is part of the main lounge so it has a bit of traffic if you want to sit there in your robes, but there are a few sofas on a raised floor which are more private. There is free tea, coffee all day which is nice (and cereal in the morning). Then there are 5 spa chairs by the pool which are usually in use - At most i think there were about 12/15 people in the spa area when we went.
The gym was large for a spa and they had all the equipment I like to use so i was happy.
The main spa area had a large pool, 2 jacuzzis, a steam room and sauna, and the spa chairs round the edge. The changing area wasn't huge and the showers were quite small to change in if you want privacy, but it was clean and equipped with shower gel and hair dryers. We weren't allowed 2 lockers which was a bit annoying as we had overnight bags with us, but we just put our non-valuables in the empty locker below.
After a cuppa and a sneaky biscuit we packed earlier, we had our treatments together which was nice - i had the lava back massage which was lovely followed by a head massage. It was calm and quiet but the moment we were finished we were told to remember that other people are waiting for the room... i.e please get out, but as i said before the customer service wasn't their forte! There doesn't appear to be any lunch facilities so come equipped or come for a couple hours.

Our bad Spa London experience started when trying to book treatments on the phone and couldn't get anyone to answer the bloody phone. Messages were left and none were returned.
We arrived today and were given a bag containing a nice fluffy robe and towel and a padlock for the locker.
Changing rooms are small and over crowded with little room to yourself. 1 private changing room for approximately 40 or 50 lockers.
When we got through into a thermal experience we were distinctly underwhelmed.two of the three interconnecting 'hot rooms' were cold!! My friend (who had been before and knew something wasn't right) went off to ask whether the heaters were on and got a luke warm ""I'll check"" from the front desk. We heard no more and they didn't heat up.
The quiet relaxation room was continually full (probably as a result go the hot rooms being cool!) and no water glasses. Suddenly one appeared, but when I went to check, it was wet and didn't appear clean, so to test, I filled it with water to see what happened. Suspicions were realised when the spa attendant later came in & simply poured the water away and put it back! Talk about a lack of hygiene!!
Talking to other girls, they said they'd complained about the hot room heaters and lack of glasses, more than once. but nothing was done. Front desk staff couldn't care less, and didn't apologise when presented with our complaints.
Showers are hot but I estimate that they stay on for less than 1minute at a time, I probably had to press it near on 10 times! Only two showers had doors for privacy and both mine and my friend's had empty shower gel and shampoo dispensers. Taps near the toilets soak you when you try and wash your hands.
When we handed back our robes and towels we asked to speak to the manager.
She however,was very apologetic and explained that an engineer had been called to sort the problem heaters. We suggested that they should out the fault on the website and inform people when they arrive. When told about the glass problem she appeared shocked.
In the end there were 9 people in total complaining with us, one of whom said that the masseur giving her treatment was running late and as a result short changed the lady on her booked massage and didn't receive the full time she paid for. Just disgraceful.
The rest of us received a voucher each, valid for a year for any of the Spa London venues- we'll try Old Street spa next time!!"

Bad bad bad! I'm pretty sure the massage therapist had no idea what a deep tissue massage is. Either way she clearly didn't want to be there and my '55 minute' massage ended up being squished into a measly 40 minutes, tops!

Reviewer12344,,,,,['london'],[' uk'],[],"Aquilla Health and Fitness Club, London",,,1 of 5 stars,"I very hardly write reviews but following my recent visit there, I feel compiled too. I booked a facial and once started (5 minutes late), it seemed good. However I quickly realised that the therapist wasn't interested in providing a relaxing service! Also, the treatment was meant to last 65 minutes but only lasted 45 minutes. Lastly, when the therapist applied the face mask and was supposed to give a head massage, she left the room for ten minutes.
Maybe they'd had a busy day and wanted to leave, but I don't expect that for a spa associated to the Rembrant Hotel and will not be returning. I strongly recommend others do not book treatments here."

MPH1984,London,United Kingdom,,,"['beijing', 'london']","[' china', ' uk']",[],"The Chelsea Day Spa, London",N/A,,1 of 5 stars,"I visited the Chelsea Day Spa on a Groupon deal was treated very badly - I don't know whether they treat all customers this way, or just the ones on a Groupon, but it was a terrible experience. Firstly, I was made to undress for my back massage In The Toilet In The Waiting Room. So I had to walk through the waiting room, in a towel, to get to my massage. Then I was shunted off to an obviously temporarily sectioned off area of the nail bar for my massage- I could hear phones ringing and people chatting over getting their nails done the whole time. Afterwards, I received the worst manicure of my life. When I pointed out the lack of cuticle work (which was supposed to be included), the practitioner actually said, 'Well maybe you should book a full-price treatment next time.' Many London businesses do not offer Groupon deals and Chelsea Day Spa doesn't have to either - why try to bring in a customer base in this way if staff are going to resent them so much? It's a very unwise move - I use Groupon as a low-risk way of trialling places. If I like them, I'll go back at full price. Needless to say I will not be returning to Chelsea Day Spa!"

We didn't use the jacuzzi or steam/sauna rooms and I would say it wouldn't be the ideal place to spend a day as they did look small with a small gym area but if going just for the treatments then very good, we had our glass of aloe vera juice which was lovely and refreshing after having walked from Clapham North (50 minutes). Our treatment lasted just under the hour, this included massage and body scrub, after which we enjoyed a glass of champagne in the relaxation area. The spa receptionist was very good and extremely helpful, the girl who did my treatment was professional and really tried to get the knots out of my shoulders (unsuccessfully but then neither can my sports masseur so not surprised). The changing areas are small and I did notice one of the bins was a bit full after our treatment but no massive problem. One downside for me was the location, which we didn't realise was quite so far from places like Convent Garden and Soho & not being from London also didn't realise we could get on a bus (stops right outside hotel) from Victoria - takes about 20 minutes, but I can't really blame that on the hotel."

They had a group booking and they placed this group upstairs (which was the best place to sit) so everyone else had to sit downstairs. It felt very crowded and I think they didn't have enough seating for every one. It was also VERY hot on the boat as they only had 1 door open for air to come in. It was also a very hot day and didn't help being at the bottom of a crowded boat.
The food was disappointing as the chicken was still pink inside so that put me off the food. Bar service was awful! 1 lady queued for 25 minutes to get a drink as they only had 1 bar open and 1 lady serving!

The hotel and hotel reception were pleasant enough and but it was almost as though things completely changed when we got out the lift at the spa. There were members of staff chatting between themselves and nobody seemed keen to help us. Eventually we were taken by a member of staff to the changing room. My immediate thought was wanting to leave. The changing rooms were dirty with one of the shower cubicles covered in sand. There were dirty towels around and we needed coins for the lockers. We were provided gowns (mine already had lipstick on) and slippers. We used the sauna (only enough space for 2) and the steam room (that still has the broken seat as per another review 8 months previously). The jacuzzi was fine although quite small. The water and plastic glasses were on a table which was in the gym. Felt uncomfortable walking through the gym area in my 'spa attire' to get to the 'relaxation room' where there were yet more dirty glasses. Sat on ripped leather sofas and then it was time for our coconut wrap treatment. This was the best bit of the day. The two girls were funny good, asking us if the pressure was right and were we comfortable. We then had to walk back past reception, with our spa product 'soaking in' to get to the showers. The showers were fine. We then had our champagne in the relaxation room which was pleasant enough. Although relaxation rooms for me at spas do not generally have a television in. Generally I was disappointed. As a paying guest at the hotel the spa would suffice, but as a day visitor I was highly disappointed and most definitely will not be going back here again."

",,1 of 5 stars,"This spa is so promising when you look at the website. I bought this gift on buyagift.com and booked a spa day for a couple of months later (they hardly had any free Saturdays). Our spa day promised a massage and a facial, champagne, and full use of the spa facilities including sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and swimming pool. When the weekend finally came around we got to the spa to be told that there were no therapists in that day due to 'snow' (it was literally spitting outside, we had no trouble travelling from one side of London to the other to get there)! We were told we could use the facilities and rebook our massages for a different time. This was really frustrating but we gave them the benefit of the doubt... We were then taken through to the 'spa' - this consists of a tiny jacuzzi, a freezing cold swimming pool that is about 1m deep and 2m in length. The sauna was nice, if a bit small, and the steam room smelt of damp and had no steam in it whatsoever. So using the spa facilities literally consisted of sitting in the tiny jacuzzi as there was nothing else to do!

With regard to the relaxation room and champagne you have to ask to get any of it as they do not explain or offer it to you. The relaxation room is a little room with a few sofas in - hardly what is promised on the website.

We were offered no reimbursement or discounts or extra treatments to compensate for the inconvenience. The experience was not cheap and we hadn't been able to have what I had booked the spa day for in the first place!! The girl on reception was extremely rude and did not listen to me at all or apologise for what had happened. To make matters worse everybody in the changing room informed me they had had their massages so we had clearly been lied to and they had just over booked and didn't have enough therapists!!

So we rebooked - the soonest appointment we could have was 3 months later..! No effort was made to squeeze us in any sooner, the service was appalling.

We came back for the second time and I have to say the massage and facial were really good. But again the staff on reception were very rude and the facilities really are not up to much. We were then told that they no longer gave out locker keys and that we had to go and get changed then come back out to reception to give them our things! We then left our bags behind reception with everybody elses and there was no ticketing system or proof that your bag was yours. It was shambolic with bags everywhere and no one knowing what was going on - so unsafe and unsettling for what was supposed to be a relaxing treat!

The changing rooms are horrible - there are two showers which are very dirty and the drainage system does not work so the whole of the changing room floor floods whenever anybody has a shower. Both times I had to wait for a shower as there are only 2 and the changing room is tiny.


Overall I would say do not use this spa. The hotel seems nice but I couldn't comment as I have not stayed. All in all - rude staff, terrible facilities, not at all what is advertised, and no customer service whatsoever. This is unfortunate as the therapists were lovely and did a really good job. The whole thing was just a bit of a mess and no one really seemed to know what was going on or have any kind of systems. I will not be going back and it was definitely not worth the money - a real let down."

",,1 of 5 stars,"I went to the hotel for a spa day to celebrate a friend's birthday and it could not have been further from the experience we were looking forward to. To advertise the experience as a 'Spa Day Getaway' was very misleading but even more surprising and disappointing was the way the hotel dealt with the complaint and I would not want any visitor to have the same experience I had.

Numerous things were wrong at the spa on the day we went there including:

My robe had make-up and dried blood on it, my friend's robe was damp
The cake we ordered had a hair in it
We were given a small locker to share and told we could leave other things behind reception despite this not being manned constantly
I was told by the hotel before booking there was a swimming pool which was not the case. The hydrotherapy pool was cold
The sauna did not work twice during the day and could only seat 3 people, the hotel were slow to respond to this
The jacuzzi could also only seat 3 people and was full for most of the day given the lack of other spa facilities
The relaxation room did not live up to its title, it was freezing and it took 2 hours with a portable heater to warm up and there were not enough seats for everyone participating in the spa day to sit down
Our package included a glass of champagne but we were served prosecco in plastic glasses instead
The atmosphere was far from relaxing, the receptionist was rude when we arrived and there were people hoovering around the gym, which you had to walk through to get to the relaxation room, and the only place where both water and glasses were available
It was not easy to get the drinks included, there was only 1 person on reception and it was made clear that we would need to request anything included in our package

In terms of the way the hotel dealt with my complaint this has surprised and disappointed me the most. On the day itself I waited 45 minutes to speak to someone and the outcome involved eating at the expensive hotel restaurant - we were offered an additional 20% off the bill which did not even cover the 11 we paid for the cake with the hair in it and the fact we were served a glass of prosecco when the package should have included champagne.

I have since emailed the Manager and upon each time of calling been assured he would call me back, this did not happen and the hotel even implemented a new complaints procedure which I also followed to still have no reply from the Manager. After 3 very frustrating weeks and several hours of my time trying to resolve the issues above I was offered a complimentary treatment but the last thing I would do now is go back to this hotel. If I had received a reply from my email or an apology from the Manager or resolution earlier I would have been much happier with the outcome.

I understand things can go wrong but have never had so many things go wrong with any hotel I have visited, or anyone take a customer complaint less seriously. I would not want anyone to have the same experience I had with this hotel and would never visit it again, or recommend anyone to do so"

The deal included a 60 minute treatment, juice and a glass of champagne. We both had a massage and facial and our therapists were great. If you come to this spa, do it for the treatments rather than the facilities or ambiance. In total we spent about 2 hours there including treatments- it is not the place to spend a whole day nor is it ideal for groups. There is a small jacuzzi, steam room and sauna and we were lucky that it was quiet and we didn't have to wait.

The spa is in quite an odd area. We couldn't work out why it had been built in the middle of an industrial/housing estate and it was a 15 minute walk from Clapham Junction. I wouldn't have been happy to walk it alone at night. For people considering this spa who are not from London, you should be aware that there is not a tube nearby but the overground train is just as easy.

In summary, if you want great treatments and are not so bothered by facilities, this place is great. However, if you want to spend a whole day relaxing or if you want to come in a group this is unlikely to be the right destination."

I had the exfoliating back massage and my other friend had the facial. It was ok, but the therapist I had was quite noisy so it wasn't very relaxing and you could hear the therapists talking in the corridor outside which didn't help. Otherwise it wasn't bad but not worth the money paid.

The jacuzzi and sauna were fine, but the small pool was out of order and the button was broken. The steam room is small and one of the chairs broken. It still worked but took a while to get any heat in the room.

There were no bins in the changing area - just a sanitary bin :/ and there was no where to put used towels and robes - except the floor. One of the showers had a drainage issue and was blocked and also the temperature control was broken and had fallen off.

Apparently we were told on arrival that we had to ask for our glass of champagne and Aloe Vera juice - but I don't recall this being communicated to me. In most spas this is usually brought out to you or you are reminded that this is to be consumed.

I sent an email to feed back to the spa. I thought that it may have been good business sense to have invited us back to have our champagne and juice and use the facilities as a goodwill gesture - perhaps I might have even booked another treatment had this been offered? After all a visit to use the facilities wouldn't have been any cost to the spa.

Our visit to the spa was quite disappointing. It has such potential, but there are a number of things that need to be addressed if it is to succeed as a spa in it's own right. At the moment it is just a very poor bolt on extra to the hotel.

Fortunately, we had a lovely afternoon tea by the riverside. The sandwich and cake portions were huge and there was also chocolate fondue to add to the tea and champagne. The service was rather slow but that was probably because they were quite busy.

Great afternoon tea but poor spa. Sadly not enough for us to return any time soon."

Their concept of customer service is non-existent. You have to pay in advance for your appointments, if you are a tourist or expat without a uk credit card they will not take your card over the phone and you have to go in and pay for your services just to get a booking. If you change your mind about a service or are booked into the wrong service as happened to me, they will not refund you but give you a credit which means you have to go back. Customer service is unhelpful. The receptionist is rude and and they are extremely inflexible. Not to mention the services themselves are nothing special. Waxing is ok, nail services are mediocre.

A day after Boxing Day..

My sister rang in the morning to confirm our booking and was told everything is fine and they look forward to seeing us quarter past two to ensure health paper work is done quickly.

On arrival, the receptionist told us our treatment times and even wrote it down for us. She did not however told us that there would be an hours delay due to a member of staff calling in sick.

We were both given a spa bag with robes and towels and was directed to the spa changing rooms. We both had at least an hour to sped at the spa before one of us go for a body treatment. The spa area is lovely, shame there isn't a hydro pool but the sauna and steam rooms are clean and really good. They have a heated seating area and another room to relax and read magazines or help yourself to water.

My sister went 5minutes late for her treatment, was no bother at all. While I waited I continued with the spa facilities... When it came for my time for the facial and body treatmen. I went to the receptionist and was told to come back in 15 minutes.
I then went back to the receptionist and was told to come back in half hours time. Someone will come as get you. No one did come and get me, I went again to see when's my treatment by this time it was 5clock the ladies behind the receptionist said because of a sick staff, they have had to re shuffle? So I was promised this time that by 5.30 I will be seen. At 5.50 I was becoming really tired of the steam rooms and sauna and just wanted my facial and body massage. I went back again, the receptionist did apologise and have me a spa day access for two gift card. I was still contemplating for my sister to get a refund because I didn't want to get on a later train.

I was then told by a therapist who came out of a treatment room to come come. I finally had my facial and it was a great one.
Lots of Elemis products, you head and scalp gets attention too. After my wonderful facial I went straight into my body massage in another room. Again the lady was nice, she have the right kind of pressure and attention to my tired shoulders.

Overall, the spa experience was ruined by the heavy time delays and was stressful because I wasn't sure if I would be seen or not, or wether I have been forgotten? Wouldn't come back here for a treatment. I have been to Hilton and Sofitel hotels and I think I will stick to hotels. More organised and communication is far better."

Their website describes the experience as an 'affordable luxury day'. 'Luxury'?? Really??? I don't think so. That would be like describing Joey Essex as an 'intellectual' or Tony Blair as a 'humanitarian'.

Changing rooms are dirty, cramped and falling apart. Showers drains were blocked and the shower cubicle stank.

The steam room and sauna were not 'that bad' (only slight good points). The rest of the areas were dire. There was a room, similar to the sauna, just a lot larger and a bit cooler. This looked like the kind of place that the CIA would use to hold rendition prisoners awaiting torture. Not surprisingly it was empty. Another room, which guests could use to rest and sleep, looked remarkably like an NHS hospital ward.

Now, the back, neck and shoulder massage treatment. This is what p***ed me off the most.

We booked two 50 min sessions, only to be told, just prior to the treatment, that in fact in fact it was only for 25 min. They had made a mistake. Nice.To add insult to injury, the clueless staff were also unsure of what treatment we had booked. Lovely.

My masseur. I'm pretty sure that trying very hard to break someone's ribs and/or collar bone using your elbow is not 'a massage'. I had the impression that, after a massage you are supposed to feel relaxed - not end up with a painful lump right next to your left shoulder blade. No, unfortunately I am not exaggerating.

In summary, I went with a feeling of anticipation and excitement. I left with a feeling of disgust and disappointment....and great pain.

Avoid, unless you like wasting your hard earned money."

After a multi-million pound makeover it is still - filthy and unhygienic. Indeed the smell is rank especially in the steam room and showers. It used to have a vibrant atmosphere of multi-cultural clientele - it is in the East End after all. Now few of the regulars go there and the clientele is mainly white females who can't afford the higher prices of more upmarket spas. The problem is that it is owned by the infamous Tower Hamlets Council who have contracted it out to a private organisation 'Greenwich Leisure Ltd [GLL]' trade marked 'Better.' They have in turn imposed draconian rules that have completely spoiled the ambiance of the place. When I was there in November 2012 The floors were scummy with dirt from people's shoes (it was raining outside). The price was 20+ as a visitor. There was no more free of charge traditional Yiddish schmeis. The draconian 'etiquette' rules on the website state: ""Treatments will only be provided by GLL trained therapists, or qualified third parties who are in possession of an appropriate license and insurance."" And they are so expensive that they have priced the previous multi-cultural clientele well out of using the place. And female staff wandered into the men's changing area; (I understand that male staff also wander into the female changing area). If you value your health avoid this place.

The floor is also quite disguising because other people do walk with shoes

The showers are not properly working neither (very hot water and then cold).
The good point is that most of the time it is not that busy in the pool.

I am glad that I had not read the other reviews before I went, because our experience was very different. Sunday is a mixed day and it was mainly young couples - from a range of different nationalities. I think I was probably 20 about years older than the rest of the clientelle!
To be quite honest, I have never seen so many men in a spa - I think they had booked to get themselves back on their feet after a stag do - they were leaving as we arrived!
We booked the Escape London Experience and the treatments were excellent. We had an hour to warm up in the spa then a salt scrub, sea algae facial and a swedish massage. Both therapists were well trained, friendly and knowledgable. The spa is due to change to Elemis in the near future, but the algae facial was one of the best I have ever had. The therapist told me that they have a number of regulars who come just for that.
The therapist who did the swedish massage only works at weekends - she works at a hospital during the week. She was excellent and knew a lot about sports massage too.
Yes, there are a few things that could be put right - a broken hairdryer, a toilet door with a dodgy lock, and putting furniture that is not water resistant in the rest room - people sit down wearing swim suits leaving a wet patch for the next person - not pleasant!
However, the hot rooms are great and we found that the treatments were too.
I think they have men only days twice a week, women only days and mixed at the weekend - but check to make sure."

Which they were informed of over the phone on booking. When we arrived the experience had morphed into the deal that they were currently promoting which was the massge and body wrap / facial. We decided to let this pass, as we both quite liked the idea of the wrap.
We were given our locker keys and a brief tour, and then it was time for the treatments, which were great. We were both treated at the same time, and the wrap followed straight on from the massage which was great.
After the treatments we decided to use the facilities for a while, and we were lucky as the jacuzzi only holds three people and the sauna and steam room could sensibly hold no more than 4.
The main problem that we found was the size / layout of the changing room, and the number of people trying to use it at the same time! There are two showers, and two benches for getting changed on, but about 20 lockers. When we were there there were a number of other people comging and going and it was very cramped - especially when a hen party arrived! There was also only one small basket for used towels / gowns, which was overflowing and made for a chotic experience as people kept on misplacing which items were theirs!
As we were finishing our treatment one of the staff asked if we had received our free champagne yet, which we didn't know about. We had to ask the receptionist as we were leaving, as I don't think she would have mentioned this otherwise!

The Millennium Dome
Battersea Park
The Tate Modern
The South Bank

Theyre all situated on the most Northerly echelons of South London. Any more North and theyd be in the Thames. Indeed, it seems what South London has to offer has all been built right next to the Thames in the brilliant shadow of that which looms prettily on the rivers North side.

But theyre all great tourist attractions, arent they? The Tate Modern has a long bit and then some art which is often deplorable nonsense. The London Eye is a big Ferris wheel only you have to pay 500 a go. Battersea Park is a great park but its in Battersea so whats the point? Just go to a different park that doesnt contain people that live in Battersea. The South Bank is nice to walk along but is also peppered with boring bits and walkways under bridges which are drenched in the familiar reek of urine and desperation which is synonymous with South London. The best thing about the South Bank is that you can look out over the Thames and pretend that there isnt a terrible wasteland looming noisily behind you like an indiscreet prowler. The South Bank is also good for finding a bridge which you can use to cross over the North where you can start enjoying life.

Many reading this with a knowledge of The South will be blankly opening and closing their mouths, dumfounded as to why I wouldnt highlight such cultural hotspots as Clapham and Brixton. Having been to both Clapham and Brixton, I can cheerfully report that even if they were The Best Places in South London, this essentially means nothing because North London will always be superior so everywhere in North London will be better than The Best Places in South London. Digging a little deeper in to what it is like to spend time in these places, one can quickly discern that Brixton is a horrid dive and Clapham a bland and ugly parody of its inhabitants; soulless chancers bouncing around the place like a more boring version of Pong, groaning on about rugby and draft lager and commons.

Indeed, the South of London is very concerned with Commons. Visitors should be advised that all of the South London Commons are rubbish and, for the most part, extremely dangerous. Never go to Clapham, Mitcham, Streatham or Wandsworth at the best of times but by all means avoid their respective Commons. Instead, pack a nice picnic and jump on one of the many convenient and well-connected methods of transport to Finsbury Park or Regents Park or Clissold Park or St James Park or Hampstead Heath or Hyde Park or Green Park or Victoria Park or Holland Park. In the same vein, The South will try and woo you with talk of Hills. Streatham Hill, Brixton Hill, Gypsy Hill. Herne Hill. All are dismal slums and should be avoided at all costs. Never trust anyone who lives in any of these places, certainly if they have the means and wares to live elsewhere. Should someone mention living in one of The Hills, finish the conversation as politely as possible and make your excuses, taking care never to speak to them ever again.

So far, I have presented measured responses to The Souths admittedly spare appeal. What I havent yet touched upon is that The South is a grizzly fissure, soul-suckingly glum, bleak and monotonous. Penge, Croydon, Tooting, Mitcham, Morden, Sutton, Hackbridge, Merton, Wandsworth, Earlsfield, Balham (never trust Balham), Thornton Heath, Norbury, Raynes Park, Phipps Bridge, Peckham, New Cross, Selhurst, Deptford, Lewisham, Streatham, Shadwell would all have the exact look and feel of the End of Everything were in not for the unavoidable fact that such places are cripplingly less interesting than even the longest and most consummately wrought purgatory."

Toppo_12,Leicester,United Kingdom,,,"['chelles', 'london']","[' france', ' uk']",[],"Colin Crosby Heritage Tours Day Tours, London",,,2 of 5 stars,"I attended this guided walk with my family and have to say we were all quite disappointed. Even making allowances for the weather which was wet, windy and miserable the tour lacked quality in content and delivery. We have attended other blue badge guided walks and can honestly say this was by far the worst.

The tour which was supposed to have lasted for a 2 hour duration, on the night actually lasted around 1hr 20 mins with around half of that time spent walking around the High Cross shopping centre (during busy late night shopping) listening to stories which were anicdotal in nature and delivered in our opinion with little story telling skill.

Most of the stories were very short with poor content, we were left waiting for punchlines or gripping endings that never actualy arrived. On several such occasions we were surprised to see our host rushing off to the next location while we were left waiting to hear the nonexistent conclusion to his ""stories"". Storytelling is an art form and not something that comes naturally to everyone. Sadly I have to say although a nice enough chap, Colin seemed to lack the ability on the night to make his stories come to life.

We were expecting far more from this tour, none of Leicester's iconic stories were included and hardly any of the historical settings were used as backdrops for the brief stories that were told. Affording the benefit of doubt this may have been an off night induced by the miserable weather, however I would find it difficult to recommend this guided walk on the basis of our particular experience."

We saw the yellow Duck - not easy to miss - and decided to go on a trip, based mainly on the amusing banter from the guy with the advertising board. As it was a spur of the moment decision, we hadn't seen the earlier reviews.

Our experience mirrored that of Kirky099 and we found the trip to be enlightening, educational and amusing. The splash down into the Thames at Deptford was entertaining for our 5 year old... and for us as well!

All in all, we would recommend this. It seems that whatever teething problems there were earlier in the year have now been resolved and if you are in this part of town, it's definitely worth the money. Clearly the previous negative reviews have been mainly around pre-ordered tickets and we can't comment on that - just turning up and paying seems to do the trick though."

I did look up the so called spa online before going and the site looks as though it was worth booking. But I guess anyone can put together a good looking page to advertise a relaxing spa!

At the end of a very uncomfortable pedicure I also got a bit grossed out and concerned about the hygiene of the treatments which resulted me in heading straight home to scrub my feet with antibacterial cleaner.
The entire experience was horrific and there were a number of times I thought about just walking out and in hindsight I really wish I had. A few of the issues were
 Nail varnish  Only had around 20 colours all very similar of miss matched brands to choose from. Looked worse than a personal collection someone would have at home.
 Equipment used  was old, dirty (nail files were very old and dirty), not professional standard (Sainsburys basics polish remover, pound shop style foot files (not sterilised!). No proper salon grade equipment at all. It was my first ever pedicure where a Callus Remover was not used or even available in the room. The reason I get a regular pedicure is because of my hard skin on my heals. I still have this today after receiving my pedicure yesterday. This has ever happen to me before.
Nail job was not good  when I mentioned I was not happy she just waved me away very rudely. Was meant to be a spa manicure and pedicure but I do not think the service I received would be classed as an express manicure at every other salon I have been to.
 Pedicure was not professional at all. I had to lie on a very uncomfortable broken bed and raise my feet up while she put a domestic foot spa on the bottom of the bed. This was very uncomfortable and awkward. She did the entire pedicure with me half lying on a very uncomfortable bed with my back unsupported as I needed to keep my feet down the bottom of the bed so she could work but my back was not supported by the back rest. She mentioned if I was OK and I answered No, I have never had a pedicure like this before and I dont like it. Her answer was every place does every treatment differently. The end result on my nails was not a professional standard either.
 To top off the awful experience once she had finished with the very poor pedicure she just tipped out the dirty water, did not clean the unit and just put it in the shelf ready for the next person to use. This was terrible hygienically and I immediately went home and put anti bacterial spray on my feet as I really questioned the hygiene of everything in the so called spa.
Overall the spa and experience was not professional and I do not think this particular venue should be sold in the form it is on Groupon. The other two salons may be different but the Wimbledon one should not be classed as a Spa. I am left feeling quite discussed by the entire experience.
I am in the process of trying to get a refund from Groupon for this visit it was so bad!

No staff about and certainly no cleaners, vanity cases were empty and the showers leaked all over the 'dry' changing area (which has no benches only two chairs) so you have to all stand and fight for space to change by your locker.

I had tried five times to book a group spa day here for seven people but thank goodness no one ever bothered replying to my emails and calls - I went just with my sister to try it first (booking for two people was fine via phone) and relieved I did not take seven family members to endure this awful experience!

It is too small and not up to standards of even a public leisure facility. The treatments were to an acceptable standard but over priced (80 for a facial). However, the gym, location and grounds are lovely but that is it I'm afraid. Hilton should do better.

Virgin have pulled the deal from their site, and I see from the Meridian Duck Tours website three months later that tours are still ""temporarily suspended"", without any explanation anywhere to be found of what the trouble is.

The class itself was really interesting (apart from the cheesy feet smell - you gradually accustom yourself to it) and we will definitely go again, but we will never return to SoHot. An email from them asking why we had not returned after our first session was answered by my with complaints of the above, and not even acknowledged by SoHot. Pretty poor all round."

",,2 of 5 stars,"i had a Turkish hammam in Turkey before which was amazing and missed the experience so much so when I saw a deal online at this place I booked myself and a friend on it and made the day trip down to London.

On arrival we were told to get change in this very small changing room with nothing more than a bench and few lockers in it. It won't fit more than 2 people in it. A Toilet was available separately at end of the corridor. We were then asked to go into the steam room where we were told to apply black soap on ourselves which wasn't what I expected as I expected the treatment to be serviced by therapist not DIY!

Anyway we then stayed in the steam room for about 20 minutes then the therapists came and did the exfoliation with the mitt which to be honest was more painful than relaxing. Then a watery mud was thinly applied onto out back before we were told the treatment is completed. We were offered massage at extra cost, 15 for 15 minute or 30 for 30 minutes which we didn't have.

When we were getting changed we were hurried and was told to come out as there was another customer waiting to get changed.

Overall I didn't enjoy the experience as it was totally different to what I expected. Environment and facilities were poor. I don't know if I was expecting too much but for 65 for 2 people it wasn't worth it. Will not return."

It was a bitterly cold day and we arrived early (1.45pm) thinking we could sit somewhere warm and have a cup of tea before the event started at 2.30pm. WRONG! We werent allowed access to Bacchanalia (because they were still setting the room up) until 2.20pm so could either sit in a cold reception area with no view, or wander around in the cold. We decided to take a stroll along the river as we normally frequent the other side (Borough Market, The Globe, Tate Modern). Finally 2.20pm came and we were ushered into a lift which took us to an upper floor, into a large room with a fantastic view of the Thames. We signed in, deposited our coats (I wish Id left mine on as the room didnt really warm up and when we asked for the temperature to be raised, we were told the building temperature was controlled by a central management system and nothing could be done) and went to our allotted table - the majority of tables were set for 6 people. The room was nicely decorated and the tables laid with white table clothes, cutlery and 9 tulip wine tasting glasses, four of which held white wine (not very much I might add), four had red (again a conservative measure) and one was empty. We were very excited and was looking forward to the wine tasting, intertwined with a delicious lunch (to be served at 3.30pm) to give us examples of how food influences the wine.

Unfortunately, we were looking thirstily at our 8 wine glasses only to notice how dirty they were, VERY DIRTY, in fact so dirty, all of my husbands had to be replaced. We called over one of the servers, a young man called Joe, and showed him the mucky glasses and he said it wasnt anything to do with him as the room was already set up beforehand. He did apologise, begrudgingly, and asked if we wanted them replacing (a rather stupid thing to say). I couldnt believe it - it looked they hadnt been washed and you could clearly see the dirty lip marks around the rims and finger marks and general dirt around the glasses. I had two of mine changed and one other couple at our table had three dirty glasses changed as well. Our hearts sank - dirty wine glasses at a wine tasting and not just one but several? Oh Dear - not a good start!

By about 2.45pm the room was full and our MC, Chateau Harry introduced himself and his colleagues and the wine tasting began. I must admit it was very interesting going through the whites and then the reds, firstly looking at the individual wines and then comparing them to each other. We were given pen and paper to make notes. At 3.30pm our starter was served - a delicious rose of smoked salmon with lemon and a slice of what I think was Liver Parfait - too light and moussey to be a pat, but absolutely delicious. After this, we started tasting the red wines, comparing, smelling, tasting etc. We had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the main course to be served, which we were really looking forward to and whilst we waited Harry told us some stories of his life, tasting and sampling fine wines and food.

The main course was served which I looked at in horror and sadness. The menu said Scottish Sirloin Beef with New potatoes and variety of salads. The photograph on our leaflet showed a large table generously laden with a smorgasbord of delicious-looking food. How wrong was this? We were served two wafer-thin slices of cold beef, half a cold jacket potato which had been sliced into three, two cherry tomatoes and four green leaves (Lamb I think). I looked at my plate in disbelief. Where were all the delicious salads? Why had we had to wait for a cold plate of food? This must be a very bad joke! The other people at our table looked the same as we did, but we were hungry, cold and also needed more wine as the meagre measures were all but gone.

The Tart au Citron served for dessert was delicious and we were given a dessert wine to compliment it which was delicious. I had told the organisers we didnt like Roquefort cheese which everyone else had and were given a little block of cheddar  tasty enough but a tad dried out and cracking around the edges. Oh Dear!

All in all - we wouldnt attend one of these wine tastings again. We wouldnt recommend attending one. It wasnt value for money. The food was diabolical and not what we were lead to believe we would be eating. The venue was cold, the serving staff indifferent."

For starters, I have been a member of this club off and on for the last four years. The facilities are great. The cardio machines could be better but generally speaking, the gym is state of the art. It is never crowded and the pool is wonderful.

The downside? Service - as in, there is none of it. Once you have been sold the membership, you're on your own. For a TINY club, you would expect a more personalised approach. The staff almost go out of their way to ignore you. Strange. Anyhow, this is how the club has (and most likely always will,) work. John (front of house for everything,) is lovely and the Italian manager seems like he has a good business head on his shoulders, it just baffles me why more emphasis on customer care has never been a major issue for the club. True, it can 'afford' to be aloof but politeness (as your mum must have told you,) is free. It doesn't cost anything to smile or greet people with a friendly 'hello.'"

'],"Luxury Travels And Tours - Day Tours, London",,,5 of 5 stars,"We booked a trip with this company to the Isle of Wight back in the summertime when we thought it would make a great summer day trip. Unfortunately we didn't get onto booking while the weather was warm and when I went to book, found out the tours were booked out way in advance. The superstar reservations team were great though and gave me options when there were spaces on tours available in the coming months. The first time we were able to book was October which I was quite nervous about as I didn't want to take the tour in the rain and cold! We locked in a date and then a few weeks later had a disruption that meant we had to change the date. The reservation staff were very accommodating to this and changed the date without any complaint. What superstars!

The day came around and we got up bright and early and headed to the pick up point. I was gutted as the rain was pouring down but was hopeful it would clear up. The bus, driven by Ray, arrived right on time and we piled on board where we were welcomed by a bright and chirpy tour guide (I want to say her name was Sarah... can't quite remember... the American one!). She was an absolute delight and kept us well informed about the day ahead. We drove comfortably for an hour and a half, often entertained by Ray and Sarah (i'm going to go with that name for now!) until we arrived in Southampton. Here we got a quite rest stop while we waited to board the ferry. We sailed easily across the straight, arriving on the Isle of Wight to find the rain had been and gone and the sun was beginning to peak through the clouds.

We drove for a further 45 minutes and then arrived shortly before lunchtime to the beautiful seaside town of Shanklin. There was so much to do there! And so little time! We were given two hours so while some went to the adventure area and mini golf, we took a walk along the beach (the sun was really heating up now!) and checked out some of the beachfront restaurants with live musicians. We decided to check out the Shanklin Chine (which literally takes about 15 minutes) and then head up to the Old Town where we had a nice lunch.

The second part of the tour took us to Osbourne House, where Queen Victoria holidayed, lived and later died. A great place to learn about the royal history, check out the house, the Swiss Cottage, wander the gardens and visit her private beach. We had about 2 hours there too. There was just so much to do on the Isle of Wight and this was a really great taster to see all the island had to offer.

It was honestly such a great day, and the fact it was October didn't matter at all. It was a wonderful chance to get out of London and explore and wow, I would recommend this tour for all, especially if you're on limited time. The company were really great too. Highly recommended."

I went along with my sister and we both really thought that we would be cooking various dishes. However it did not really involve cooking at all but more like prepping food to make it pretty for when dishing vegetable etc onto a plate. All the cooking aspect seemed to of been done by the chefs before we all turned up for the class. So basically all you are in effect doing is making sauces to pour over the meals and prepping vegetables etc for the example slicing tomatoes up, blitzing sauce together in a mixer, etc. and you only get to do one of the course as you are all split into different work stations for a dish. It was nice though prepping along with other people and sitting down all together after. The food was all presented nicely but for taste it was just ok in my opinion and you get small portions and nothing was hot just cold or luke warm. I did not like the cod starter that I made with others as was sort of raw however I did like opening the oyster up.

For the price it is my advice is f you want a cooking course then book somewhere else."
Scoobysnax77,London,United Kingdom,Male ,,"['st albans', 'kumasi', 'london']","[' uk', ' ghana']",[],"Aveqia, London",N/A,,2 of 5 stars,"The chef made clear that he wanted our groups to produce very high quality plates. But unfortunately, this seemed to mean we couldn't actually get involved in much of the cooking. Learning to scotch quail eggs (?) was interesting, but our whole group missed cooking the actual quail because we were busy balancing slivers of radish on croutons.

I did try to explain this to the chef at the end, when he asked what I thought of the evening. I don't think he was very impressed with my feedback - I got a simple lecture on the quality of food he wanted to prepare and how my crouton slicing had let the thing down (I agree about the croutons completely, and I'm at peace with this modest failing).

The basic concepts work for me: connecting through cooking is a fab idea. To some people, this could mean standing around with a glass of wine and occasionally grating horseradish, while we watch a professional chef do his thing. But I really love cooking - as I suspect do a lot of people who pay for the experience - and I wanted to learn more, and actually cook much more. So when my mum asked whether I would recommend this for my dad I said no. You can lecture on the ambition of the cooking all you want, but until you work out how to give people the chance to actually get involved in the cooking, this great idea simply Will. Not. Work.

Which is a shame."

My friend who joined me on the night, his job was to cook pancakes for an hour, not easy on the terrible equipment.

The large group was divided into 4, each making a course. That for me was the problem. If I go on a course teaching me how to make a 4 course meal, I want to do exactly that. I wanted to learn but floating and hovering over the other tables I felt I was asked to go back to my station and stir my curd. I've no idea how any of the other courses were prepared, cooked or even what ingredients were used. That's really not what I paid for and I left very underwhelmed by the whole thing.

To make it worse, both chefs split their time between two classes, one next door and ours. We barely seen our chef for an hour or so.

Sadly, I can't recommend this place at all. Perhaps this business was the inspiration of someone with great vision to do something really unusual, but turned into sloppy execution by some accountants, trying to squeeze the most paying guests in without considering the quality of the lesson.

Another example of this, is the additional wine option. We both paid 30 extra to have wine with our experience. From the measurements, I guess one bottle of moderate tasting wine went around 6 people!

Poor show owners!

A true hidden gem and escape! The place is built under the railway arches under Cannon Street station. This is what gives it such a unique atmosphere instead of a warehouse which many health clubs now feel. The staff are always polite and welcoming on arrival, once swiped in you pick up a towel and sweat towel from the towel desk (how many health clubs have one of these?)

They now have brand new CV equipment with personal TV screens that include Sky Sports 1,2,3, Sky News, BBC News, T4 music and the 5 analogue channels. There is a upstairs CV studio which has 4 Plasma screens. Only the CV studio has piped in Music (KISS FM / Capital) which is so good having to listen to the rubbish LA fitness play in there gyms. There are 4 studios which accomdate one of the most comprehensive class timetables of any gym I have been to, one of these is a very large Spin studio which has new spin bikes. There is also a studio with fixed weights, boxing ring and power plates which are free to use (unlike LA Fitness). It can get busy at peak times but the size of the place and variety of equipment means you never have to wait long. There is also a female only gym and 2 squash courts.

The changing rooms are clean and very modern with free shampoo, shower gel and conditioner. There are a total of 3 male changing rooms and 2 female one They are cleaned very frequently unlike LA Fitness who cant be bothered to clean there changing rooms and look like something live the local tip. The mens also includes a trouser press, iron and tumble dryer. There is also a steam room in the upper male changing rooms.

The 2 swimming pools look stunning under the arches, a little on the small size but the venue makes up more than enough for that. At the side there is the 8 Hydro Spa beds, these are great as your whole body floats!

There is more, walk past the spa reception and down the stairs and you have found the retreat, you would never think that you are in the middle of the city now, there is a very nice new steam room, old style sauna with the coals which can get very hot and a huge spa pool which is total chill out zone. Plus there is a relaxation area which has been refurbished with overlooks the Thames and now has feature lighting.

There is also an outlet of the Bagel Factory and Sweetshop as well. The lounge are also has free wifi now! The whole place is pure quality and has a very middle class feel to it. The facilities are all well maintained and clean unlike LA fitness. In my view LA Fitness, Virgin Active, Fitness First all are miles behind this health club.

It is also next to a really good Fullers riverside pub for a post workout drink!

The main negative I can think is the guest pass price of 15GBP which is steep, but quality never comes cheap! One way around this is to use 500 nectar points to get a free day pass, see the nectar website. The membership fees can be high, but one way around this is to get a policy with Pru Health private medical cover, once you reach Platinum status its only 25GBP a month, what a bargain!!! They do loads of corporate deals, my employers one is 55GBP a month which also allows usage of all other Nuffield Health clubs, I hear the new Nottingham one is a bit special!"

As it was for my anniversary I decided to go ahead with the treatments.

Flomeny the manager refused to return my calls despite calling more than 4 times. We had an email dialogue and on 3 separate occasions she called me by a totally wrong name despite me correcting her each time. Simple bad manners.

Furthermore, she then went ahead and cancelled my treatments (which I had booked for my anniversary as a surprise) for my husband and I at the last minute. I had to call Groupon three times on one day -they went through to head office and it was confirmed that my bookings had not been cancelled. However, Flomeny had taken the liberty to cancel my treatments despite the fact that she had asked me to confirm that I would still be attending!

Flomeny, refused to give me the complaints procedure or the details of her line manager so I could liaise with them. All in all a shocking service. The booking had been made months in advance and no where in the small print did it state that Antara Spa and Flomeny could cancel at their convenience at the last minute.

",,5 of 5 stars,"Nearly two years ago, I walked past the big dark wooden door  and was immediately pulled into this beautiful boutique Hammam on Fulham Road. The friendly girls working there, the interior, the decoration and the smell already brought me back to my previous Hammam experiences, whether in Turkey or Morocco.

Yes, it is not the posh and spacious greek-roman baths in Baden-Baden where I come from, but the result for me is the same, if not much more personal:
everytime I go there (usually every 2-3 months), if with a friend or on my own, I close the big door behind me after a couple of hours, my skin squeeking clean, pores free, mind relaxed, deeply calm and smiling.
Every other time I treat myself to a 30 mins back massage, which I absolutely love getting there! Tailored to my needs and special requests, I feel light and upright.
A nice chat with the girls and sweet cup of proper Moroccan mint tea are topping it off.

I always try to allow myself having 2.5 hours of time and no appointment directly afterwards, as I personally enjoy hanging out in the steam room for a little longer before getting scrubbed.

Will go back there soon!"

The foot 'spa' was literally this: I was provided with a plastic bowl which looked like it had come from the kitchen sink. This was filled up with barely warm water and a tea bag of some sort and then I was left to ''enjoy' this 'spa' for 15 mins. This is not a foot spa. This is something I could have done at home for free. The massage was ok, but again...I could prob do this myself for free.

",,1 of 5 stars,"This spa/ salon has recently opened where 2 well liked primrose hill businesses (including a salon used to be) despite local protests at yet another chain on our high street a friend's recommendation of their notting hill branch and my sister's rapidly approaching birthday made me over come my fears. The cafe inside seemed busy and small for the numbers of people trying to eat ini it, but the food did look good.
Sadly this initial ok impression was completely taken away by one of the rudest staff I've ever had the bad luck to meet. I wanted to get a gift card for a pedicure go my sister, which would seem simple enough but the lady assistant was horrified I didn't know which of the 3 pedicure variations they offered my sister might want. I ended up young for the cow shed which seemed luxurious at an hour but not silly with the moisture wrap and 15 minutes extra of the next pedi up ( my patience for having my feet beautified is only so long and an hour's my limit). I then asked to book a waxing for my soft but this was too much we had to complete the pedicure order first. I handed over my card to pay and the assistant said it was declined. We tried it again and I held onto the machine which said no dial tone. She ran it a third time in front of her manager who then ran it on a different till and it went through, the supervisor apologised and said they were having IT problems.
I explained that perhaps next time they are having IT problems perhaps not announcing a customer's card has been declined ( when it hadn't their phone line was down) to the assembled customers would be appreciated.
The original assistant simply replied it was declined and offered to write my appointment times down. I told her not to bother as I was unlikely to return and I would leave it to my sister to make her own decision ,as I suspected by the long blurb I was given before buying the gift card- (valid for one year , can only be done for a monetary value , not a specific treatment and they keep no record of it so if you loose it tough! ) they wouldn't be refunding me my money.
Having spoken to other locals I gather the varnish lasts well, but the treatments are nothing special for the prices they charge and frankly if you have to go through customer service like that for a 48 pedicure I would definitely say it's poor value for money.
The assistant manager did call to apologise after I left , but it all seemed too little too late. I suspect won't be wasting my time there again"

The tour guide who worked for the company was polite and constantly on the phone trying to get updates and it transpired that the coach had broken down so they were trying to hire a replacement as the company doesn't own it's own coaches (they hire them). It wasn't until after 9am that we were eventually told by the tour guide that the trip was cancelled and that we could either contact the company on the following Monday to either request a refund or re-book our trip.

",,5 of 5 stars,"I just wanted to take a moment to recommend Moroccan Beauty after the wonderful morning I spent with them Saturday, April 26th and explain what to expect here if it is your first time! I booked a 10:30 AM Hammam Ritual with a Full Body Scrub and a Body Mask on special for April. I found them easily after taking the nearest tube station as they are quite recognizable by their beautiful door. Upon arrival I was taken to a waiting room that was bright and airy. Music played in the background and the decor was charming. (Check out the gorgeous chandelier!). Not even ten minutes later I was asked to step into a changing room where I was allowed to choose a locker and change into my bathing costume and provided flip flops and a towel. I was pleased to see the changing room provided a blow dryer if needed later. I was then shown the steam room which is again gorgeous! I want to tile my bathroom just like it. There is a place over one of the benches where you get scrubbed to hang your locker key and they will take your towel for you to keep it dry.The lighting is low, providing a relaxed atmosphere. I was told how to begin which is to rinse off first in the showers towards the back of the steam room. I opted to use cool water since it was pretty warm already and the steam was not on (I was the first customer of the day). Then I was told to use the black soap all over my skin and settle in to steam for 10-20 minutes. I was also showed where the steam comes out and warned to keep my distance as it can be quite hot and there was even a statue to prevent customers from sitting in front of it getting their legs burned. Once you soap up, you are asked to sit in the steam room and allow your pores to open and the soap to just absorb. Be careful not to make the mistake I did and use the soap near your eyes as there is so much moisture in the room when it steams it can run into your eyes and sting, (My face gets so dry I thought it may be helpful to use some on my face while steaming because it was so moisturizing). Also the individual pot is for you alone, so use it! I was modest in using the soap as I wasn't sure if others would be using it. When I think about it, that was a silly mistake since others probably wouldn't want to use it after me. I thought the soap smelled fantastic! I then sat to steam. I have never been to a hammam nor used a steam room before and let me just say it is very steamy! It felt almost uncomfortable to breathe since I wasn't used to it but then I was checked on and shown where to get some cool water to drink from the fountain and that helped a bunch. You will be just as thirsty as if you were in a dry desert so stay hydrated! I was also told I could rinse the soap and asked how much more I wanted to steam before I was scrubbed. I chose 10 min and while it doesn't seem like a lot, I felt it was all I was prepared to take since I wasn't used to it. When the scrub began I was asked to lie on my back and they used the Kessa glove on me. I turned over to do my other side and sat up when she did my arms. It felt amazing! You'd be amazed at the skin that comes off you and I exfoliated two days before with a scrub at home. I then rinsed the dead skin off me and the clay mask was applied. I stayed there on the bench while the mask absorbed into my skin for about ten minutes and was told I could wash up when I was ready. I used the hair products in the shower as well which smelt great. I then dried off as much as possible and went to change. You can stay in the steam room as long as you like. There is a hamper for your towel and plastic bags for your wet suit in the changing room (although I brought my own). I wasn't sure what to do with the flip flops but when I asked, I was told I could leave them in the changing room where they were. I was then offered a tea which was minty and sweet! I sat and relaxed a good twenty minutes in the waiting room before getting up to leave and pay. I opted to throw my wet hair in a bun so it would dry curly and go makeup free back to my hotel (I only brought my moisturizer and a comb with me anyways). There is only one changing room so you may not be able to take as much time in there as you wish if it is busy. I recommend making plans to stop at home or at your hotel to finish your beauty routine if you need to dry your hair and do your makeup. I was always checked on and asked how I was. Everyone was super nice and knowing it was my first time, everything was explained to me. They answered my emails promptly as well when I first contacted them for more info. I had a lovely time and the next time I am in London I will return to this hammam. I hope to use their other services as well and get a facial or a massage on my next booking! Thank you to the lovely ladies who made my first experience at a hammam so wonderful!"

It is not the most luxury Hammam / spa i have seen but the owner is Moroccan and extremely welcoming and discreet. We felt really at home and did not want to leave. I even ended up staying a bit longer for a facial. They use their own products that are made in Marocco - all natural.
I agree the changing room is really tiny but it did not really bother us as we knew each other.
Highly recommend it for an afternoon of pampering with your girlfriends or a hen party !"

",,3 of 5 stars,"Decided to try this place and as I wasn't sure what to expect I kind of hoped for the best. I had massages before and I did feel pampered and relaxed. I didn't feel very relaxed during my experience here...There is only one changing room and sometimes there are 4 girls trying to change and the room was very small. it was very uncomfortable.. I was glad I bought my own slippers!!! the place didn't feel like the cleanest!!!

the hamam itself was ok. again it just felt like here put this on..weight...take this water..and at times I felt a little uncomfortable. you pay for these things to feel pampered and relaxed.

then I was told that there are scrubbing mitts but they were used and if I wanted a new one I would have to pay..i mean this is not very hygienic and they know people will want to buy their own...felt a little coerced into buying my own....!!!! surly if You book for a scrub and pay for it all everything should be included!!!!

the scrubbing didn't last very long but it was nice to see your dry skin come out...

all in all...wasn't the most pampering experience.."

",,1 of 5 stars,"I managed to get a wowcher deal for 2 people costing just under 60. After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting something of an average standard. However, we were quite disappointed by our experience.
We arrived at the spa, but could not find a bell to ring in order to get inside. The windows were all blocked, so we could not get the attention of anyone inside. We finally realised the door knocker and having knocked it for a couple of minutes, someone finally came to open it. The lady was friendly but we felt very awkard as she appeared in a shower cap and sweaty vest and leggings.
We were led into a tiny cold waiting room, which resembled nothing of Morocco. The atmosphere in this room was very cold, uninviting and the decor, bland. Another lady who was friendly too, came in and took the wowcher voucher from us and led us into the changing room. She gave us some flips flops which were old and dirty. They even had the hairs of the previous person who used them on them. Surely this could have atleast been washed quickly before being given to us. They were absolutely disgusting!
The changing room was one of the tiniest rooms I have ever seen in my life. There was hardly enough room for 1 person, let alone 2! In addition, it was freezing, which really put us off wanting to get changed into our bikinis ! Once we finally managed to get changed, we were led into the steam room, which we had hoped would warm us up. Unfortunately this had been switched off and was only turned on about 5 minutes after we sat in it. We were freezing at this point! Eventually the lady came in and told us to put some black soap all over our bodies which we did. Finally then the steam room was switched on!! We were gradually warming up! We were given plastic cups of tap water to drink while we were in there. After a while in the steam room, the lady came back and explained that the KEESA glove which she was going to use to exfoliate our body, had previously been used on other people. See said we could either use that one or purchase our own for ""a very cheap 5""!!! This is certainly not cheap and we had no prior knowledge that an old glove would be used on us. Having looked at the used ones, we saw dead skin on them, so decided to buy a new one, costing us 5!! We were then scrubbed by the lady, which was done relatively well, although I think it could have been done much more thoroughly. This is a spa and it is their job to do this well! We then showered and had a clay mask put on our bodies. Following this we had our final shower which was rushed, as the lady was standing watching us, holding our towels.The shampoo available was of a very poor quality as well. It did not feel like something which should be offered in a spa. We did not get any privacy and felt extremely rushed! We then returned to the tiny FREEZING changing room where we quickly got changed back into our clothes!
This was certainly not the SPA experience we were expecting. The atmosphere from the beginning was uninviting,the temperature was freezing, the lady made us rush, we were given cold tap water in plastic cups and it was unhygenic (dirty flip flops and used gloves with dead skin on). I had read that customers were offered mint tea on departure. However after having waited almost 10 minutes after we got changed, in the waiting room, I enquired about the mint tea. The lady explained they had run out of mint for the past 4 days! This was a ridiculous excuse! Surely this could have been substitued with some type of herbal tea?!
We left this spa very disappointed and felt colder than we did before we entered this ""spa"". We would never return, even if it were free!"

",,3 of 5 stars,"First the good points: they did well with this space -the interior is cool and the 'cowshed flair' works well. I didn't know they had a cafe in there too. It looks nice, cosy and inviting (if you don't come with a wheel chair or pram). Apparently you get a free tee or coffe and can enjoy the cafe before/after your treatment(s) but unfortunately the busy girls at reception failed to inform me about that ( I wasn't even offered a glass of water befor my facial and massage which quite frankly opposes the concept of any cleansing treatment which both facial and massage essentially are)
But this was quite sad really as this visit was a special treat for me as a young mum as my fiance surprised me with booking it and offering to babysit. I would have loved to enjoy a cappuccino afterwards but had to rush off afterwards.
Now to the treatments: I was impressed by the facial, the therapist really knew what she was doing and gave me well aprecciated recommendations. The massage following however was of very poor quality and just consisted of a few strokes with aroma oils ( I studied physiotherapy and am a trained masseuse so I know what I'm talking about). Quite a rip off at these prices!
The manicure and pedicure area looked relaxing and fun for a nice girly afternoon maybe and I would come back there and for a facial but do not waste your money and time on having a massage there!! I also think the staff in general could cheer up and come back down to earth because they all seem a bit arrogant and snobbish with their heads hogh in the skies which does not fit into Primrose Hill at all."

We both thought that Moroccan Beauty was fantastic! The girls err lovely, from letting me in early to giving us tea and baklava before we left. The treatments were just lovely - a steamroom for about 15 minutes, with black soap applied, then a body scrub (which took ages and was amazingly thorough) and a body masque. After that it was on to the facial - a totally relaxing scrub, creams and facial massage. Then the tea and baklava for a perfect end.

We also took the opportunity to have a facial after and it was worth every penny, the products smelt amazing. Once we were done we were given more tea and felt very relaxed and calm.

The masseuse ladies came in and covered us head to toe with large towels. They started to gently massage us over the towels as a warm up. Then they started to uncover us section by section as they massaged us with what I believe is lotion. It didn't feel as slick and greasy as a massage oil. It was a full body massage but they do pay special attention to sections where there were a lot of knots.Overall the experience was definitely worth it.Great service! The therapist is very attentive and able to address all my needs every single time . I will keep coming back. Would definitely recommend.

I have had many massages but to date Mary you are the best and so one day before by return flight home I went back for 1 1/2 hour session with Mary to again release my tightness from 12 days of walking all over London and again I thank you for making my 8 hour trip home very comfortable.

We got there nice and early so were one of the first on the boat and had really good seats, however those arriving close to sailing time ended up either standing, at the back of the boat with the wheelhouse blocking the view or inside by the bar. The bar prices were quite expensive but always are on these trips. The trip itself was good value for money with discounts being available on production of a valid oyster card (T&C's apply), a travelcard or student card. The boats run every 30 minutes with the barrage tour being every hour and stop at a number of places en-route at which you can jump on and off. The guide/captain was very knowledgeable of the area and was very witty, having us all laughing out loud in places although if English was not a first language some of the jokes would be lost. I would highly recommend this trip and the company as it was good value, the boats were clean and tidy, and a much more gentle and relaxing trip that the faster clipper services to Greenwich."

",,5 of 5 stars,"I was treated to a pedicure for my birthday. I had never thought to have a pedicure; I thought them an indulgence that fell well short of say, a massage. Well, here I was so very wrong! The pedicure was a luxury one and so cost 55 which seemed eye-wateringly expensive, however it included leg massage and head and shoulder massage too. The venue is quite simply decorated, in a domestic style, sitting you at a family size table before bringing you into the treatment area. All kinds of drinks are offered and chilled water with lime and mint waiting. The therapist brings you a huge choice of nail colours to pick through without rushing you. They will help you choose if you get stuck! The treatment area consists of large white armchairs with plump pillows to cuddle while your feet are dipped in a warm bath. My first pedicure here was exactly that; my first! The poor therapist spent rather a long time buffing and smoothing my untreated feet, but when she had finished with all the gorgeous oils and creams and the immaculate polish, my feet looked incredible and felt a hundred times lovelier than usual. The head and shoulders treatment was such a plus with essential oils for uplift or relaxation and delivered with real skill. This took almost two hours and consequently can be heartily recommended without hesitation. Can't wait to justify my next trip!"

",,1 of 5 stars,"Worst place ever- do not book

I was actually put off from the start when booking the hammam treatment over the phone, the receptionist was rude and hostile she sounded like she was doing me a favour by booking this treatment!
On the day of treatment i was running late due to circumstances- i called to inform the spa half an hour before my treatment of this delay and called AGAIN to update and apologise when i was on my way, the receptionist said they have back to back bookings all afternoon. I fully understood this and since the delay was my fault entirely, i explained i was flexible with rearranging the day/time since i had a week before my voucher expired, to my surprise i was advised to 'come in today and we will see what we can do' i didnt understand hw they would accomodate me if they were fully booked that day but accepted the offer.
I arrived to a fairly cold welcome and was ushered to the changing rooms and then steam room- a place that charges 80 for a treatment and doesnt even provide clean towels or unused flipflops was immediately disappointing. It was not at all the standard i had expected. I was also surprised that since i was told they were fully booked, NO OTHER CUSTOMER was there THROUGHOUT my time.
I was taken into the steam room given a very small pot of black soap and told to apply it all over, the steam would be turned on then i will be asked to wash off. I was immediately stunned at this- the whole point of a hammam exp is to relax and be pampered to be asked to just apply things yourself is not at all relaxing!
I waited for what seemed like a lifetime for the steam or atleast the therapist to let me know if i can wash off the soap, finally the therapist came in to just flatly say 'wash the soap off' no explanation about the fact that there was no steam! I asked if the steam was working to which she simply said 'no' i did not get an apology no explanation NOTHING.
As a paying customer i was disappointed that the steam which is an integral part of the whole hammam treatment was out of use but to not even be informed about this or apologise for the inconvenience is unacceptable.
The therapist spent no more than 2 mins scrubbing my body with the mitt followed by applying a very thin layer of a watery body mask then told me to shower and a facial will follow. Thats it! I was shocked with the lack of washing which is usually what a traditional hammam is all about- to charge customers a price of 79 for a 2-3min scrub is unbelievable. I have had a much better spa experience in other places and paid far less!
The facial was no better, although this therapist was more pleasant her technique was very poor- it felt like she was trying to get rid of a stain on my face! She was far too rough and all that was involved in the facial was applying 3 different types of lotions/creams then removing them!
I was so relieved when it was all over, i went to ask the receptionist if i can speak to the manager regarding the issue with no steam/ lack of communication, the receptionist was extremely rude and said 'you dont really need the steam in hammam' i politely asked again if i can speak to the manager she said 'the manager is at home you can call to complain if you want' i explained that i didnt want to complain just wanted to give feedback she still said 'here is the no call her yourself' i asked if she could make the call from the spa so i can speak to her to my horror she said 'no i cant call her from here if you want to speak to the manager why should i waste my money!' I was absolutely dumbstruck with this appauling attitude and didnt know how to respond to this statement. The therapist who did my facial seemed to understand my concerns and offered me her mobile to call the manager. I asked that despite having a landline in the spa why they simply couldnt call the manager they just shrugged and said that they couldnt do it. I have never heard of such nonsense! It was a simple enough request, Clearly the manager is not bothered about customer feedback at all and expects customers to spend their own time and money if they wish to address concerns.
The therapist eventually called the manager who is called Nadia. I explained the situation about the steam etc and to my amazement all she said was that steam is not impt in hammam! I explained i have had many treatments before and i do understand the need and importance of each step of the treatment and to me this was an incomplete treatment, she continued to defend this and also didnt think it was necessary for staff to apologise/inform me of the inconvenience, she then went on to say that i was late but they still accomodated me and i should be grateful!! i apologised again for being late but she made comments to suggest i deserved a poor experience just because i was late!!! despite informing the spa IN ADVANCE of my delay, being flexible with rearranging this appointment and apologising many times i felt i was discreetly penalised in some way since i was late.
i can see why this place has such incompetent rude staff and poor reviews it is because the manager herself does not value customers at all or the service provided. The phone call to the manager cut off mid conversation and when i attempted to call back nadia did not answer.
personally i have had many many spa treatments in both renowned and smaller hotels and establishments not once have i experienced such poor customer service, poor treatment and unacceptable attitude.
This place is a complete rip off, it does not provide value for money, they treat customers badly, lies about their booking slots, does not value customers but most disappointingly is not willing to even consider a simple apology."

",,5 of 5 stars,"After a short walk from Fulham Broadway tube down into Kings we entered Chelsea Harbour. Once we had stopped admiring all the yachts in the harbour and eventually walked through the door at the Blue Harbour Spa we were greeted with a choice of fresh tea/coffees and iced water. After completing our treatment form details and ordering lunch with a glass of wine we were issued our locker keys and access card for the doors within the spa.

On the ground floor is a state of the art gym for those who want to partake!

Onto the 1st floor and from the minute we walked into the changing area we had arrived  white robes, slippers and an endless supply of thick soft white towels. Locker room is spacious and well equipped from individual q-tips and cotton pads in bags to a set of scales if you dare

Through to the wet area you notice the smell of oils emanating from the steam room and there is a large and very hot sauna. Using the steam takes a bit of getting used to as the oils are very strong and will cause your eyes/nose to feel cold surprisingly not unlike using a vapour rub on your chest. Both the sauna and steam are excellent especially the sauna for stretching out and doing a bit of Bikram Yoga. There are four spacious private showers with shower gel and shampoo (no conditioner) and two toilets with own hand basins.

Through the door to your right you then descend a few stairs to the pool area. Plenty of sun loungers for relaxing along with ice water and reading material. The pool is a lovely temperature and depth for swimming or just relaxing. The Swan neck jets are great  be warned the force of the jets is very strong and takes some getting used if you have not used before. The pool area is at lower ground level but has been built with one side looking out to the harbour courtyard so plenty of natural light.

As ladies that do lunch we had a the salad, salmon and cream cheese bagel and Chicken Club Sandwich all washed down with a glass of wine in the main area overlooking the harbour which was lovely.

On the second floor are the treatment rooms and the ultimate relaxation room complete with camomile tea. Plenty of relaxing seats with footstools and relaxing loungers with the softest light waffle blanket/towel for the ultimate relax either before or after your treatment - in our case both

I had the full body aromatherapy massage and my friends had the full body de-stress and the full body massage  all exceptionally good.

We managed to spend over 7 hours relaxing and being pampered and will certainly go back again."

",,3 of 5 stars,"Me and my friends visited this spa over the weekend and had a lovely time however we probably will not return as there are many areas where they can improve. The day before our booking we were call to confirm our booking and were asked what time we were planning to attend. I said about 10am as I had made sure that I booked the whole day and not the after 2pm option. The lady said that we could only arrive after 2pm. When I reminded her that we had booked the whole day she said that it would be very busy with hotel guests if we arrived in the morning. I found this ridiculous  I would have paid for the cheaper package ! We arrived at 11am in the end and the changing area was empty and only a few people in the pool.

The spa is located at the side of a very grand hotel, there is no access through the hotel it is down the side road. The spa is located on 3 levels; reception, tea area and fitness suite on the ground, spa and changing areas on the next floor and the treatment and relaxation area on the floor above this. The stairs between these levels felt like fire escape stairs and wasnt the easiest to get around. The ladies at reception are not very pleasant  they do not even try to give you a fake smile !

The changing areas are pleasant and lovely shower and toiletries provided. The sauna and steam are far too hot. I am a regular goer but they were rather small and therefore the settings could have been turned down. The ladies before us left complaining and we didnt stay very long. As a result I saw no one in there the whole day.

Pool area is clean and has loungers but if it was any busier we would have struggled. There are 8 loungers and a few chairs.

I had the 30 minute massage and it was very good the pressure just right and the lady did a great job  after the massage she out a nice hot towel on my back and I felt very relaxed indeed. There is a relaxation area which has lovely loungers however it was cold so was the treatment room and generally we felt cold when we left the pool area.

Cream tea is served in the reception area and given that you are in your dressing gown and right by the door its little cold ! We had a choice of teas and lovely scones ! There is no real option for lunch either !

Generally we had a lovely day but the facilities need a little fine tuning and the higgledy pigledy nature of the layout wouldnt have been an issue if we were happy with everything else."

Someone accidentally split their drink on the mixer, which cut the music off after 45 minutes. This was clearly a accident, however the boat management have pointed the finger and haven't taken responsibility for their lack of security and protection around the equipment. Anyone could have split their drink over the equipment as it was just there on display, right next to the dance floor. The whole organisation, boat, music and food was a shambles.

",,3 of 5 stars,"This was a long-awaited treat but there is a lot of other better spas in London. I'm surprised this is the standard in a 5 star hotel.

Had their most expensive package, with 1hr massage, 1hr facial and pedi. The job was well done in the end- felt very relaxed and skin glowing, great nail job. The girls were friendly and great. The exfoliation was a bit of an ordeal as lots of the grainy elements went into my eyes - just was surprised she hadn't noticed that they could go in if you rub them across your eyes in two routines? I couldn't open my eyes and complained..The result, again, is great but it was really unpleasant experience for a 5 star hotel, I'd expect that in a shop in Whitechapel.

Very relaxing lounge area but very dark. Don't even think about being able to read your favourite book/magazine you brought there (I tried in vain). It's also swelteringly hot. Also, you cannot order food/drinks like in other spas. Shame, I even checked out their restaurant menus and was prepared to pay an exorbitant 5 per tea.

Changing room was not as expected out of a luxury spa. Very small, only one bench across 100+ lockers so no one can sit if three ppl at max sit their with their towels, etc scattered. The locker doors open from left to right so if you are given one in the corner (like me), you'll really struggle to open and get your items out.

Given the therapies on offer, you'd think there is a range of skincare to try after taking a shower - no chance! I was more than surprised about this as I did not bring any of my own as most other spas do unless they are budget spas. So if you're going, take all your skincare regime + your own hairbrush (none there) + prepare to fight for the just two hair dryers (that's quite faulty and one chair to sit, way below the mirror) that has...one chair to sit. The mirror is not eye level so you might as well stand if you can.

The set up of therapy rooms and pedi room to changing room is all a little confusing and bothersome - you'll be going up and down flights of stairs so if you have any injuries or disability, this is going to be a problem for you. Yes, there is a lift but everyone uses it for just one floor so there is a little frustration and awkwardness with others while you wait.

One of the main reasons coming here was the swimming pool as it looks lovely on their website. Forget relaxation - there are too many children (mostly under 5 + exasperated parents) and it totally killed the mood. This was sat but the parents/nannies (mostly Russian for some reason??) seem like they are local and wouldn't contain themselves to just the weekends. Unfortunately, on the telephone when I booked, I was firmly told that I cannot come until the appointment time - then found out that I could have come a lot earlier and used their pool. Conflicting information, wasted opportunity and money :(

Although the results of the treatment is great, the whole experience was not so overall rating as 'Average'."

Having experienced hammams in morocco before, i was expecting to receive an hour long washing ceremony, but we were instead ushered into a room which was supposed to be the steam room and told to shower and then rub on the oil (presumably argan oil), wait and then shower off. The steam eventually came into the room but as a friend of mine nearly burnt her hair on the candles we sat there not fully sure of what our treatment was supposed to be. A lady then came in and with a scrub exfoliated our skin.....hammam over!!!! Then followed the facial..... 30 minutes of bliss this was not. Applied to my skin was oil, massaged for about 3 minutes and then a face mask. The therapist then left me for 10 minutes. Gone were the beautiful sounds of paradise instead i heard children running up and down the stairs and corridor and therapists chatting in the kitchen. When the therapist finally came back it took 2-3 attempts to wipe the clay mask off my face leaving most of it around my hair line.....a final moisture and i was done!!

To say this place is missing a few finer details is being kind (wet towels, used flip flops in changing rooms, cold changing room areas, cramped treatment rooms, charged for towels!!!) .....there was a real lack of customer experience and with just a few simple adjustments they could create a lovely place to go and relax with a loved one for half the day instead this is no place i would return.

Our discount voucher cost us 30 usual price is 80 for this treatment...if i had paid full price i would have been seriously annoyed. This place is lacking some vital customer service skills which would allow the customer to feel like they were in a traditional Moroccan hammam AND essentially come back for more treatment ....isn't that the whole point!!"

",,2 of 5 stars,"The hamman was nice. The soap and the scrub made you feel really clean afterwards. The offer I purchased came with a 30 minute massage at the end. The massage was awful. Probably the worst I have ever had, the masseur couldn't have put in any less effort if she tried. I had to book a proper Thai massage the following day. The young child constantly wailing and screaming downstairs didn't add to the relaxing ambience either. And I didn't get a full 30 minutes.

I'm not sure whether I would've got better customer service had I paid full price but surely the point of Travelzoo/groupon offers is to attract customers? They DEFINITELY failed to do that.

I will not be returning."

",,1 of 5 stars,"I'm afraid but I had such a bad experience on the phone that I will never even try to book an appointment again. I had a voucher and I called just one month before it expired. When I called in, a girl took the call and she was so incredibly unfriendly that she put me off completely. I had seen the place from outside and I was curious about it, with the voucher I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try it. The girl told me that there was no appointment after 5 pm, which makes me think that if you work (unless you work in front of the salon), you can only go to the salon at the week end. This is already a big restriction. Then, she told me that even at the week end there was no availability until the the day my voucher expired. When I kindly said that it was a bit weird that there was no availability for one month and it was becoming hard for me to book a treatment, she just said that they have plenty of clients. This is when I realised that she didn't care about having a new potential customer. I booked my facial anyway. The day before I received a message about bringing along a towel and a stuff...and this was the final drop as she didn't tell me on the phone and also I've never been to a salon where they don't even provide you with a towel. And for a facial??? I cancelled the appointment as I'm not really prepared to waste my time to go somewhere where they clearly don't want my custom. I lost my voucher, but it's all good. I'll keep going to my usual salon where my custom is valued."

PAnn904,London,United Kingdom,,,"['beijing', 'inverness', 'london']","[' china', ' uk']",[],"Fitscape, London",,,5 of 5 stars,"Spending a week exercising in Southern Spain in August first had me a little worried, but it really couldn't have been a week better spent. Fitscapes venue in Spain was fabulous--lots of space for guests to gather together or have quiet time on their own, different locations for the training sessions, challenging runs and great hikes. The Fitscape team was incredibly talented--very instructive, creative (and patient!) in the sessions--but above all, enthusiastic and energetic. Their program was really well balanced between working out and chill-time, so you could tailor your week as you wanted. The quality of the meals was an added bonus I hadn't expected--all around, my experience far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to sign up for the next one. Question is---do I go back to Spain, or check out their options in Italy, France or Morocco?"
Raven-Valentine,,,,,['london'],[' uk'],[],"Angel Therapy Rooms, London",,,1 of 5 stars,"I came to the angel therapy rooms recently where I had booked to have a 30 minute Indian Head massage. On arrival I was given a questionnaire to fill out which I was told was important for the massage to be tailor made. Having completed a course in massage I know this to be true especially in terms of pregnancy and how massage can affect an unborn fetus and thus was shocked when all of the questions pertained to data collection for future contact and, I assume, marketing. Not once was I asked if there was a possibility I might be pregnant and, if there was a real reason for having the questions, they were so vague that they would need to be explained or some check boxes added for the information to be at all useful. One such questions was: 'Comment on your diet' with a small space given in
which to do this. I filled out the form and handed it back to the woman on reception who I found to be unfriendly and cold.
Once the massage therapist
took me through to the room she asked me to get unchanged and lie face down on the bed - which I was a little confused about as an Indian Head massage does not normally require this. When she re entered the room I explained my confusion given that I was having a head massage only to receive the reply that we had a lot of time for that so I assumed perhaps it was to incorporate my head, neck, shoulders and back. I think approximately 15 minutes was spent on my back during which time I flinched and asked a number of times for the pressure to be reduced as the girls finger nails were not only digging into me but also the pressure was causing me a lot of discomfort.
After some time had a passed I was then informed the massage was over and to collect my things. At no point was my head touched or massaged, in fact I had a completely different treatment to what I wanted and asked for.
Leaving the room to collect my coat from the reception I found no one around and was forced to get my coat myself.
I advise anyone thinking about coming here for massage to be careful as the treatments are very expensive and, based on personal experience of having regular massages in London, this is by far the worst I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.
I certainly won't be going back."

",,3 of 5 stars,"We actually thought we had booked at the harbour club spa so were nervous when we realised our error. Determined to remain open minded we found the correct spa!
Parking is extortionate so used the NCP which will cost about 13 for 4 hours.

The afternoon tea we had with our package was served in the reception to what can only be described as a gym entrance. The afternoon tea... Consisted of two raisin free scones pp and some over brewed tea. Not really worth it.

This is basically just a hotel gym with a few treatment rooms.
The only time I felt relaxed was when I had my massage.

There's no jacuzzi, aromatherapy room... There is a gym so we made sure to use it otherwise I think we would've been bored.

The pool was nice and warm but as the hotel guests can use it there were kids everywhere hardly a relaxing experience. (My cousin said there were no kids when she was in the pool)

We came as two couples and had checked prior to arriving it would be suitable. Unfortunately the saunas are attached to the gender specific changing rooms so you can't mingle with your other half.

I would like to say good value for what we paid but unfortunately for 90pp you could get much better. They should stop marketing this place as a spa as my gym has better ""spa"" facilities.

The men's toilets I'm told were like a sauna and the ladies constantly smelt of turds.

Don't go out of your way to go here it's not great you can find better for the cost.

On the plus side the staff are all friendly and I enjoyed my massage. Contrary to some other reviews we did receive shower gel. The men's slippers were too small for the boys and no flip flops for the wet areas."
Mahabaha,Vancouver,Canada,,,['london'],[' uk'],[],"Fitscape, London",,,1 of 5 stars,"I used this company twice. However, the second time they sent us to a very unsafe location and their service was terrible. I contacted them during and after and posted my comments on their website. They keep deleting it. They are violating the mis reprentationact by only posting 5 star ratings. Here is what I expeinced and they don't care and don't respond to my emails.

Dear Simon,
I see that you do not post any review unless it is 5 stars. It is false advertising as well. I wonder how many clients like me, tried to post and you would delete them. When I logged in your site to book, I was impressed with the reviews. However, now I know it was controlled and not accurate.
I have contacted a solicitor in the UK and they have advised me to contact ABTA and to follow the procedures for arbitration and record a complaint against your company with them to be posted on their website.
I will also peruse my complaint and review and send it to the Sunday times and the Conde Nast Traveller Spa Awards 2014 committee and other agencies that protect consumers rights.
I am obligated to send you a SECOND REQUEST as per the steps of ABTA procedures to negotiate and try to solve the issue.
Hence, this is the record for my second request:
1. When I booked my holiday in April, I was sent an email with the wrong dates in March.
I contacted the staff and I was told, sorry.. Mistake.
2. I received a letter with info on the resort in Morocco; however, the phone number posted was wrong. The number was for the resort in Spain.
3. I was told that I should wait for only 20min for another couple to arrive and the driver will be waiting for me at airport and I can give him my suitcase and relax at the caf.
After 8 hr flight from Doha, I arrived with no signs of the driver. I started to call the number on the letter and there was no answer (I was calling Spain!). Hence I started to worry and called the London office. They said they will check and came back with driver is on his way.
Driver arrived an hour late and then we had to wait another 30min for the other couple.
4. I have requested a single quiet room because I am a very light sleeper when I reserved my booking and paid the amount. Upon my arrival I was given a room facing the busy gathering in the courtyard and was told: see how it is. I told them to change it and they said they couldnt. It was a very noisy room facing the tennis courts and the courtyard.
5. The host, at the first dinner, did not have much to say. She was really not interested in the guests at all. No explanations on our first day at all or how the schedule works and the sheets they gave us. Some people missed their massages because it was not explained.
6. First run in the morning, I asked specifically on the route and if we all will be in the same loop. They said yes and we started. I was not in the fast group nor in the last group but in the middle. As we ran, I saw many forks on the road and kept trying to see where other people where and there was no sign of anyone. I got lost and had to back track my route. Some of the walkers actually asked about us and advised Petra that we were nowhere to be seen. The staff, had no idea and nor did they care.
7. My biggest complain about the holiday is that you have chosen a very unsafe Villa. The Villa is at the bottom of a V shaped area .The weather changed and we had a major rain storm and the villa got flooded with rain water and sewage water within a couple of hours. It all came gishing into the villa and in our rooms. It stank of a horrible smell and we had to rush all our stuff on the beds and your staff kept sweeping and trying to get the water controlled. We were told by Petra that we are stuck and we cannot go out or anyone comes in the villa until the next day. The electricity got cut off for a few hours. So we were stranded. If for any reason, one of us injured themselves we have no way of getting any medical attention.
We got to know that the roof and the big chandelier in the villa have collapsed in September due to the same rain storm and hence, there was just a plastic cover over the court yard. The flood happened before and yet you continued to use that villa even when it was not safe. It is a Health and safety issue. We trusted you and unfortunately you took advantage of our trust. The place was not a 5 star as you claim to be.
My friend Mahis room was unusable that night and Petra suggested that she moves into my room without asking me. I obligated and told Petra that I paid for a single room for a reason.
And I will gladly host my friend Mahi in my room, however, I should have been asked and I also look for In:sap to deal with this matter. No response.
8. Following the flood, my room stank of sewage smell. The staff was giving me their own scented candles so I can overcome the smell and keep using my room.
9. I went to one of the group training sessions and it had boxing segment while we do sit ups with a partner. Your young big trainer came a few inches from my face as I was lying down and yelled and screamed with such anger at me. He told me I was not good enough and not doing enough. I was on the floor and could not really move. I started to shake and got very upset. I went to your host Petra, after and told while I was shaking and crying. He has seriously offended me. I did not pay for boot camp. I have paid for a yoga, fitness and good nutrition week. Not to be yelled at by a young trainer at age 54. After that session which was a Monday, I did not attend any of his group fitness classes. I missed Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
10. I asked the other young trainer for a 15min of his time to show me how to stretch my hips. One of the other guests said he was really great at certain exercises needed for tight areas. He did not obligate me because he said he was busy. He wanted me to book a full private hour with him. He was free and I saw him with other people sitting around and flirting with one young client.
11. As for the nutrient one on one hour session that you offered. It was basically commercial. Tania listened to me and kept on saying, I cant say, I wouldnt know, unless you hire me back in London and I look at your blood tests. I have no medical issues, I just gained 8 pounds in the past 4 years and wanted to know what to avoid. Most of the hour she just stared at me and told me I can hire her through skype and here is the website.
12. We were offered two massage sessions as part of the package. One was great and the other one was horrible and everyone complained about it. It was a waste of money and time.

I think the fact that we have posted our reviews and your staff keeps deleting it means that some other clients may have had the same issues and yet no one would know. It is false advertising. Consumers need to be protected.

I will purse sending photos of the mud slide as well as the Vila to news papers. You won awards you do not deserve."

But my experience wasnt like that at all. Overall the trip was very organised and a happy one. We arrived and the lady greeted us kindly then we went into a small Moroccan themed lounge where we sat and filled in a questionaire then she led us through to the changing rooms (yes is very small but was perfect for the three of us) We then changed and went into the steam room which was lovely and clean and nice and steamy. We recieved some sort of Moroccan black mud to rub on our bodies to prepare for the scrub which was nice. After about 15 mins of chilling in the steam room we were called one by one for the scrub. I have been to three other Hammams in Morocco and all scrubs have been fairly long. Overall was happy with the scrub however was done very quickly in comparison to the other times I have gone to Hammams. After we went in the shower to wash and the water was extremely cold. The lady explained the boiler wasnt working properly and she kindly brought us warm water in a bucket which was very nice of her. I am sure they will fix this problem. At the end we had three lovely cups of Moroccan mint tea waiting for us in the lounge which was very pleasant. Overall very pleasant experience, staff are LOVELY especially the young girl with curly hair. Dont listen to the bad comments, try it out for yourselves.

There appears to be no regard for health and safety with used sanitary wear not cleaned/picked up from the bathrooms (both the bathrooms!). The whole place smelt damp and musty, with spilling sanitary bins! Changing rooms haven't been maintained and I don't think the therapists are qualified.

",,3 of 5 stars,"Overall I did enjoy my experience to the hammam, I went with a friend and I think a dose of the giggles and a blind eye to the not so great aspects made it fun but I wouldn't say it was the height of luxury.

The lady at the front desk was a bit gruff with us and it instantly ruined the atmosphere for me, I think in turn it made us more critical of things we might have overlooked had she been a bit nicer. For example I was given the hammam experience as a present and my friend had forgotten to tell me to bring a towel. When I explained this to woman at the front desk, she gave me telling off and then grudgingly offered me a towel for 2 from the HUGE pile of towels they had stacked behind the front desk.

I felt it was a little unnecessary to give me the dressing down for not bringing a towel when they did have some available for those who might have forgotten. Quite frankly I would prefer to rent a towel then drag home a wet towel but on my part it was a genuine mistake having not brought one... The changing room is REALLY tiny and I was thankful that there wasn't another two people in there with us. There's also no where to hang up your swimwear while you go for your massage, this would have been helpful to again prevent having to take home wet items in your bag - especially as we had a whole day and evening of activities planned that day. The actual steam room was nice, not as steamy as I expected.

Again the lady who greeted us at the front desk took us into the steam room, she didn't quite explain what we had to do and so we spent a long time just sat there wondering what on earth should be happening! We then had a another lady, thankfully a lot more friendly and helpful. She explained what was going to happen and then gave us the body scrub treatment. I have to say, never expected anything quite so vagarious! It definitely leaves your skill feeling amazing after - if not a tiny bit sore.

The massage after was lovely. The room was extremely small and my masseuse was struggling to get round the table properly, so it was probably more unpleasant for her than it was for me. However the first impress you get walking into a tiny room is a bit claustrophobic. My friend had the gruff lady from earlier and actually was very complimentary about her massage with her. So at least she was good at some aspects of her job!

After the massage I was again left hanging around.... I think this happened a lot with us. There just wasn't a lot of customer care, someone around to explain what you needed to do, where you needed to go etc. Eventually my masseuse lady reappeared and said I could return to the changing room and she would leave me a drink in the lounge. When I went up to the changing room, other guests where in there, so again a lot of awkward side stepping and attempt's to change without getting a body part in the way of a stranger! They do have a hairdryer in the changing room, but in using it I gave everyone a home-made sauna to beat the steam they just had! It was just TOO small in there.

After I changed, I went into the ""lounge"" area and had a lovely sweet mint tea, really nice. However I still needed to pay for my towel and we waited and waited until finally someone appeared. Once I paid, we were happily relaxed and on our way.

Overall, I would say the spa is good value for money, not necessarily the best, but if I lived locally I would probably go again."

Yes thats right I said fish, or to be more precise Garra Rufa fish. They are a small fresh water species native to the Middle East and sometimes called Doctor fish. Basically you take a seat, submerge your feet in a warm tank of water which is continually pumped through a filtration system and ultraviolet sterilisers. Lots of tiny fish nibble away any dead skin leaving feet smooth and soft. They dont have teeth so they dont bite; they simply snack on dead skin cells.

When I first told my friends where I was going I had the usual jokes  good cod, its a load of carp, I'd try it too just for the halibut and so it went on!

Once you are past the initial what am I doing/this is weird/it tickles 30 second mark its actually very relaxing. I love reflexology and though this is very different, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like fine vibrations over your feet and is apparently helpful for conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Some people prefer not to watch the fish do their stuff so they read or use their laptops but I was completely fascinated. 30 minutes later my feet emerged feeling baby soft.

Jane our instructor did a fine job of teaching and providing pointers on how we could improve our skills.

Groups are small, no more than 5 people (that was the size of my group). We meet at Liverpool St train station which was within walking distance of the predetermined ""shoot"" locations, talked a bit about what our goals were, where we were going. We were given a map of where we were going, in case someone got seperated or lost and headed out on a fantastic September Saturday to explore the East End and take some great pictures.

I thought Camera Trails covered all the bases quite well. I got my monies worth and brought home some great pictures and increased my photography skills. I would definitely recommend this walking tour if you are in London!!!"

People of all ages and from all walks of life were keen to give it a go; there are even separate classes for children. Every one is equal with a spray can!

Introductions over, our first lesson was in putting all the equipment together, shaking loads of spray cans and fitting the nozzles on them correctly. Andy then explained the different effects we could achieve as well as highlighting, outlining and blending colours. Everyone was dying to get spraying so without further delay Andy marked out a section of the wall for us and we were each assigned two letters to interpret as we wanted. The great thing was colouring outside the box was allowed and positively encouraged! I have always thought graffiti was an amazing art form but what I came to realise was that it isnt easy. You have to keep shaking the cans to stop the paint from dripping and it takes time to cover large areas. A can equals approx two medium sized letters so you are looking at a lot of paint for a large wall. After a while all that spraying does make your hands and arms ache. That aside, there is something amazing about having no limitations, thats what graffiti is all about. Andy left us pretty much to our own devices but was always on hand to offer help and advice if we got stuck. There was no question of are we having fun yet? We were! There was constant laughter and stopping to inspect each others work and comment on a cool effect or interesting addition. Once we had finished our letters we swapped places to add extra finishing details. Everyone was happy with what they had achieved personally as well as the end product. Andy was a great teacher as well as a gifted artist, he made learning fun, it wasnt like being back at school. There were no teachers pets, everyone was treated the same regardless of their abilities and positively encouraged to get the most out of their day."

We were accompanied by our guide who was a genuine London character who gave us a little history and a lot of really cool stories.
It was a different way to see Buckingham Palace, the Lifeguards, Westminster Abbey etc but the best thing was just to enjoy a ride around the hidden parts of Hyde Park. Most of the tour was well away from the traffic on private lanes and through the park.
Definitely Highly Recommended!

On arriving, nobody opened the door, so we had to stand outside for 10 minutes. We were then told to wait a further 15 minutes before we could changed. During that time a therapist asked if we could keep the noise down and was really rude with a poor attitude I felt like a 5 year old being told off by a teacher. We then went to get changed in a small changing area, where other ladies were (there is no private area to get changed). We then were told to go to the steam room and wait there. At no point did anybody tell us what our voucher entitled us to or what we were going to do, it was as if we were expected to know! The hammam was good, we then went downstairs for a facial (all i had been told was to put my things down on the side, only when she began did I know it was a facial!)
One of the therapists is rude, arrogant and not friendly which is what you expect when you go to a spa. The treatments were good, unfortunetly the service was lacking. Needless to say I will not be returning!"

",,5 of 5 stars,"I got the hamman and massage deal and booked my appointment without any trouble. There is a big black gorgeous door with a big knocker and you knock at the door and are greeted (which is a nice touch), it felt like a private members club - the place has the ambiance of a very quiet temple.

Firstly you go into the changing room which is very small but is functional. Then you go into the steam room (which has two showers at the end) and you shower, there is some black stuff that you rub all over your skin, this is like a moisturer that prepares the skin for the hamman and then the steam is put on and you relax for 10 minutes then wash the black stuff off. The haman lady then comes in and you lay on a raised black mat that is in the steam room but around the corner and water is poured over you and you are rubbed down very vigourously (forget about body scrubs, this is the real deal!). You can buy your own haman glove for 5, which is much more hygenic than using the communal one.

Then you dry off in the changing room and go down to the massage room. And the massage was the best I have ever had! So firm and so deep that my muscles felt llike jelly at the end of the golorious 60 minute massage.

Then when I was dressed there was a mint tea (which was bit sweet but lovely all the same) waiting for me in the lounge.

I walked out feeling so chilled and walking on air. The steam room looks very authentic with marble seats that could comfortably seat 8 people, the whole decoration of the place is really very calming and authentic.

All in all I was in there for about 2 and a half hours. I am definately going back with a friend for the same treatments. Bliss."

",,4 of 5 stars,"I was treated to this by my friend for my Birthday. We were both very much looking forward to it as neither of us had had a Hammam before so weren't quite sure what to expect. On arrival, unfortunately I think they were short staffed and we couldnt actually get into the building as all the therapists were in treatments and the front door was locked so we did have to wait for a while so that was a little confusing. But once we got in we were shown to a waiting area where we filled out a consultation form and soaked up the lovely moroccan decor and music. We were then shown to the changing area, again unfortunately these are very small and only really space for 2 people, i think they normally plan it so it works that there would only be 2 people getting dresses/undressed, but as they were running behind there were 4 of us in there so a little cramped! We then went in the steam room, it wasnt as steamy as I thought, but this was a good thing! We were told to shower then rub 'black soap' all over our body and then sit in the steam area a while longer, the lady then came in with the mitt to scrub us all over, we layed down so that was actually nice and relaxing too, and good to see all the dead skin cells coming off! We then showered off and dried and was taken downstairs to the massage room, where I had the best massage, so utterly relaxing and felt chilled out for the rest of the day, which doesnt come easily to me!

I came with my own hammam mitt (as suggested on the voucher) and was told quite aggressively that I should buy the salon's one as mine was not good enough and she didn't want to waste HER time . We were then left to stew in the hammam for an extra 15min while the ladies were chatting in the corridor we tried to tell them we were ready but they just continued to ignore us.

the only highlight of the day was the massage with the lovely Eva .. that bit I would recommend

The day was a gift from friends for my 50th birthday and I took 2 friends with me who had also received vouchers. To get to the ladies changing room, you walk through a small gym area which smells of sweat and rubber mats. There is one toilet and one shower in the changing room and the cleaning lady was still cleaning it when we arrived at 11am. There was no steam facility, no whirlpool and the sauna was barely big enough for 3 people. The pool area was very tatty and only had 2 loungers for post treatment relaxation which made it feel like the local public baths. We were not told at the time of booking that there were only 2 treatment beds, this meant that one of our party was left outside to wait while 2 of us went for treatment and then we waited while she went for treatment, it would have been better with an even number of people but if you go with more than 4 you've nowhere to sit. As there is nothing to do after your treatment, no waterfall showers, no steam, no ice bath, no mineral bath you have no choice but to shower and change and here we come to the next issue, only one shower. As the spa was not busy we were told we could use the gents and a brave member of our party did, but very quickly as hotel guests could wander around the spa un-escorted at any time, which they did. As for the shower I used, firstly let me say that I am an average size lady if a little tall at 5'8"" and a size 14 and I struggled to turn around in the shower without hitting the walls and showered with my arms effectively pinned to my side, the shower head attachment was broken and would not stay at a good angle in it's holder and as for the water pressure / temperature it was either a tepid drizzle or a nasty cold deluge. Now we have to get out of the shower and get dry, I already mentioned that this was a gift for my 50th birthday so you can imagine that we are ladies of a certain vintage all trying to get dry and dry our hair with one hairdryer, which tripped out when it got too hot, in a very cramped room with no air conditioning and nowhere to plug in any appliance that you brought with you. So after my lovely massage and facial, I felt hot, sweaty, crazy haired and cranky so a bit of a waste of time on the relaxation front really. Afternoon tea was nothing out of the ordinary or to write home about. This is not what I would tell my friends about this experience, it's what I have told them."

As with many senior we had are reservation and considered a bus tour as it looked so simple and with little worry. Having said that we are both a little adventurous, given this nature we began to look at places we wanted to see and how difficult it would be for us to undertake our own travel plans; the Internet is amazing!
It all started right here on Tripadvisor, looking at destinations, reading reviews about Hotels, Restaurants, transportation and so-forth. It seemed at first the more we looked the less likely it was that we could do this ourselves and the better looking was the bus tour.
In our attempt to be safe and have some sense of order we needed to take our time and plan carefully. Starting in November of 2011 with our travel places for April 2012 we started our many pages of notes.
Tripadvisor and thanks to all those whom pass along reviews we felt as if the information was out their and all we had to do was carefully read, look and plan.
Starting in February we began to book hotels based on everything we had reviewed, limits we put in place and destination chosen. By the end of February we had booked Miami, Barcelona, Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, Paris and London.
As the months passed by Trains passes were ordered seats booked points of interest noted and expenses planned.
I am not normally the most organized, and likely over thought parts of this trip but given the time away 6 weeks, the costs involved $$$$$$, and all we wanted to do planning was critical.
I was watching the news this am and with the Olympics in London there are many stories; it was funny to here how people were arriving in London and did not have British currency and all the issues they were facing not able to pay bills.
Any trip big or small needs planning and through Tripadvisor and balancing reviews we had a memorable trip, call it luck, good planning or what ever term fits we had no problems with ever aspect of this journey. There is more to see than is possible in one's life time, far to many places to go and never enough money.
Read everything you can balance all reviews as what is good for one may not be for another same goes for food. Be open minded as YOU are the guest in their country it is up to you to adapt to time, places and people. Not every hotel room will be perfect nor every meal ideal but the experiences of meeting new people struggling with language issues and compiling about your sore feet are what make the memories. If you do your home work carefully travel with an open mind and most importantly be open to change you or anyone can make their own plans.
Read through all the information you can balance it all carefully as there is a lot of conflicting stories, Train stations and train travel is far safer and easies than some reviews state,costs were less at differing sites for entrance fees, line ups were never an issue ( April-May) and everyone we met was more than willing to be helpful even if neither-one of us fully understood the other.
Make the effort, read the review and go ahead you can do it."

Well it is tucked away in Covent Garden!
Facilities: Just bring a couple of swim suits/bikinis, flip flops/slippers and make-up. It is a woman only spa. You can bare all but no-one but a very very old lady did on our visit. I won't dwell on that! but on the plus side no one raised an eyebrow. You are provided with a locker, robe and a carry bag. Cleansers,shower gel/hair gel and cotton wool pads are all provided, so is mineral water (by the cup from machines).The set out is nice with a main area where you can get a fresh juice relax on loungers and read (magazines provided). There is also a quieter area with a pool with two water exercising machines in (one cross country machine and one bike) a jucuzzi (always quite busy) steam room and sauna.There is a separate spa salt pool.
Downside: It does not quite escape the London edge. E.g. felt very commercialised, treatments expensive and I did not like the facial products used (Sanctuary own brand). Not Sanctuary's fault but a lot of rude Londoners there (no thank you for holding doors open, doors shut behind without looking if you are coming through!). Place was slightly shabby, and not the cleanest. Lunch was superb (if extra cost!). In summary if you go, I would not spend too much on treatments (time better spent using facilities) and try to go during the week. We went on a Saturday (July 2003) and I am a Londoner! It is about 75 for the whole day, or you can get a package with lunch included."

FairyGirlLondon,London,London,,,['london'],[' uk'],[],"Sanctuary, London",,,5 of 5 stars,"I've visited quite a few spas around the world and the Sanctuary is still one of my favourites - hence I visit the spa regularly.

The spa is pretty big and facilities keep you occupied for a long time (there are two different lounges, two swimming pools, two jacuzzis, sauna and a steam room). There are many treatments to choose from. My favourites include a lomi-lomi signature treatment and a hot stone facial. A Mum-to-induldenge is great for pregnant women (just remember that the temperature in the spa is a little on the hot side so keep drinking water and dipping into a pool!).

Staff is helpful and well trained. I have also fallen in love with their new product range which is far cheaper than you may expect! There is an area where you can sample all the products and get advice.

Food is always delicious, not to mention their cakes! They don't have any trashy magazines (which works for me) so if you want to catch up on celebrity gossip bring your own.

My tip would be to avoid Friday and Saturday and is gets really busy. Also, it is better to book your treatments in advance or upon arrival. They are currently doing a sleep treatment (which is included in the day or day membership) which I would actually call a 'meditation' treatmen. It is lovely - a shame thought that the tape has been the same for quite a while now.

I would definitely recommend visiting the Sanctuary if you can afford it. Go with your friends or have some quality me time."

However the spa was small,basic and the jacuzzi kept flooding this was dangerous as it made the floor and stairs slippery. Someone did come in with a mop,hardly a classy act,although she was really kind about it and whilst she mopped smiled and laughed with us.
Another problem was the cramped so called relaxing area,this was dull with limited seating space and no up to date magazines. Furthermore we were told that no men would be using the Spa and it was just for our use, so to find a man in the sauna was indeed a shock.
The woman on reception seemed to find the funny maybe it was...
The exercise pool had hair on the top of it.The steam room average. Also we were not given a robe,still the towel was handy as we had to use it top mop the flooded floor with when we could not find anyone.
Lastly the changing room was like being on a tube in rush hour,hot and again cramped. Surprise of the morning was when the shower blocked and we couldn't use it.
But I finish with the best bit there was no beautician around to offer any treatments,still if they were anything like the spa then it was a lucky escape. This does not deserve 5 stars. Again helpful staff but that is only as it should be. AVOID"

I found it to be very commercialised and almost like being on a conveyer belt - there were so many women present that the lunchtime din in the supposed relaxation room was more like a friday night in a city bar and the treatments were speedily executed due to turnover and waiitng clients outside the doors. I'd expected more of a relaxing vibe than i got and feel that the website misrepresents the space available to lounge and relax. The exercise pool is great but jacuzzi wasnot functioning on my visit last week - this basement level was quiet the whole day as it seems most ladies go to the sanctuary to lunch and down a glass or two of chardonnay rather than to get fit! The second level if relaxation lounge and warm pool is nicely presented but wasovercrowded on the day of my visit and the noise level far too high. The thai lounge is actually an alcove above the pool with 4 mattresses - some over descriptive work on the website there was disappointing. Food was available in the lounge but limited in nature and expensive. A juice is 4.50 while wine / champagne is promoted. The restaurant close sin the early afternoon. All areas were overcrowded on my visit (twilight session from 12-8pm) meaning i had to keep walking around to find a spot to lounge in between swims or treatments. As i'm pregnant, I knew my treatment options would be limited but booked this day specifically due to the 'mama to be' range of treatments and products offered by the sanctuary spa but was disappointed at my 50 minute massage which was a half hearted attempt, felt rushed and impersonal. I'll continue to use sanctuary products but feel other spa's such as champneys et al offer a much more rounded experience. This did feel like 'spa's r us' and lacked the atmosphere i'd anticipated for a sesion costing in excess of 130 - admission and massage. Additionally, hearing the staff [--] throughout the day about each other and their managers was not pleasant but unavoidable. Overall a disappointing experience."

The booking process was as simple as a phone call and the personal service received from Heather was prompt, courteous and informative making me feel confident about my choice of tour companies. In spite of the rain, Greg (our tour guide) was ready and waiting when we arrived. His personality helped brighten what was an otherwise gloomy day. During the tour he informed us not only about the sites we were seeing but also the history behind the sites, the royal family and other important Londoners. He was witty, told enlightening anecdotes, and answered all of our questions. Due to the rain, the changing of the guards was cancelled. Greg took us to other sites not normally on the tour rather than shortchange us. Not only did Greg give us tips on getting around the city, suggestions of places we may also want to see, information on other tours the company offered, he even walked us to our tube stop at the end of our tour.

We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and will recommend Love4adventure to all our friends. We plan on using Love4adventure on our future visit to Scotland.

I'd give the Spa only ONE star but the afternoon tea FIVE
The spa was very small and although shown round by a delightful young lady she then disappeared and so the spa rules openly flouted by other 'occupants' went unheaded. The exercise pool had a thick grey line around it and the chill out areas untidy (also small and taken over by the group of ladies having a good old picnic and drink)
Its just not big enough to take more than about 5 or 6 people and then they should use it for its purposes!
the first impression - the changing room where over half the lockers don't work, just sets the tone (surely these could be mended) and overflowing dirty towels cupboard - so people left theirs on the floor - nice.
However, afternoon tea was truly delicious and served with style and a smile. The sandwiches are some of the most inventive and fresh I've tasted - beetroot bread with humous, yum! The chilled champagne was poured generously and the tea selections really interesting. The room itself is a bit souless, but the charm of the staff made up for this.
So to sum up, go for afternoon tea but AVOID the spa"

First was for an afternoon tea package, so we decided to book a body scrub and facial to pamper ourselves. The guy (which we weren't warned about!) was very nice but didn't seem very experienced (qualified?). It was unlike any other facial or body scrub I have every had. His technique was along the lines of 'wax on wax off'!! The tea was wonderful though. The second time I visited it was for a champagne lunch. Again the food was beautiful but the treatment wasn't great. I booked a 30min pedicure. It was not a pedicure...it was a file and polish. Not what I was expecting.

When it was time for the treatments my slippers were soaking wet as I have been using the spa facilities. The treatments were paid separate and these were ok, although when I booked these via email the prices confirmed were different to the website, I had to ask why? and it was quickly corrected. The spa staff are not very customer service focused. Not once were we asked if all was ok. Then it was time for the afternoon tea!! such a disappointment. The cakes looked nice but did not taste fresh. The little fresh fruit salad tasted of old fruit and a small tea pot only for 1 cup of tea, when asked for more tea, hot water was added to the teapot, so very weak 2nd cup of tea. I was left with the impression that bookings via deal vouchers are not rated important by the hotel. I had visited this hotel 3 years before for afternoon tea, and it was excellent then (also a last minute.com voucher). I don't know why the standard has dropped so much. Maybe if you are a paying hotel guest the service is of a higher standard. Or maybe I selected the wrong day to visit.

",,2 of 5 stars,"Booked a spa day at the Spa and Wellness Montcalm at the beginning on February, via Lastminute.

The spa day was advertised as 9-5, but we knew we would not be able to arrive until about 12. I called the spa to explain this as I didn't want our booking cancelling when we did not arrive at 9am (we did not feel the need to have the full day in the spa anyway).

The lady in the spa, however polite, spoke relatively poor English and I really struggled to explain what I was asking and was told repeatedly that 'No you have to come at those given times,' as she thought we were asking to change the times to later than 5pm. Eventually she said that yes, our request was fine- but I still wasn't confident that this was understood. I also asked if there was availability for the spa on the date of our proposed booking, and was told that yes there was.

I therefore went ahead and booked via Lastminute (cheaper than direct booking). Confirmation email was almost immediate.

Today, a month later, Lastminute have called to say that the Montcalm have cancelled the booking as they now have 'too many treatment bookings' on our booked day. Basically, we interpret this as 'we had paid for a basic (non treatment) package they now have clients who will be spending more money and need our space.'

The Montcalm should not be taking bookings from other companies, then cancelling so close-we now have trains and hotels booked which are non-refundable.

Had this been cancelled with a few days of the booking- fine. I would understand this may be due to communication times between Lastminute and the hotel itself. However, the fact that it has been left until just over a week before the date arrives is ridiculous, especially as I DID contact the hotel directly to confirm availability for the date before booking with Lastminute."

I too had booked through Travelzoo for the massage for 2 people and the afternoon tea. It was a great deal just 89 for 2 people to have a 60 minute massage each and then afternoon tea in the Carnaby restaurant afterwards.

We arrived about 90 minutes before our treatment time to use the spa facilities. It is small and if there are anyone than 4 people then it would be a squeeze but we were lucky enough to have the whole place to ourselves most of the time and it was lovely. We had a quick swim, a sauna and then relaxed in the chill out room with our books. There are two loungers in the chill out room which overhangs the pool and a selection of magazines to enjoy. Overall the spa facilities are a little tired but all functional and ideal to waste away an hour.

We then went for our massages with Jo and Natalie who were wonderful and very welcoming. These girls are new to Sanook so ignore the other reviews which say the staff and treatments are substandard. We both opted for the 60 minute swedish massage and were treated side by side in a lovely treatment room which was dimly lit with candles and relaxing music...the massage was amazing and we walked out of the room feeling completely chilled out and relaxed.

The afternoon tea in the Carnaby restaurant was a lovely way to finish our afternoon.

Overall I think the travelzoo deal was good value for money...you are paying for the massage and afternoon tea not the spa facilities so look at these as a bonus!!"

First impressions were poor, the spa itself was quite dirty, with the bin in the changing rooms overflowing to the point there was rubbish on the floor. They had about 8 lockers in the changing room, but we were told that the keys didn't work for most of them so we would have to share. The pool area is very small and the lounge area is only big enough for two people, so as a group of four it meant two of us sitting on the floor or perching on the edge of a table. All the glass in this area was very dirty.
I didn't use the gym, but it really consisted of two cardio machines and some weights, very small and if more than two people were using the facilities there would not be enough space. The pool is not really big enough to swim in and there is no jacuzzi.
Despite being the people at the spa, our appointments were nearly 45 minutes delayed The therapists seemed nice enough, but I was quite disappointed with my nails, to be honest I could do a better job myself - they were clumpy and there was a fair amount of paint on my fingers and toes.

Despite the initial issues we had encountered when booking our treatments (no-one in the spa answers the phone, no-one gets back to you when you leave messages, making it a nightmare to book treatments), we decided to give the hotel and spa the benefit of the doubt. Indeed, this should have been a warning sign to us and I wish we hadn't bothered.

My friend emailed the spa a few days before our visit to confirm our booking and only received a reply a day before our visit, advising us that in fact the pool was out of order, but that we could have afternoon tea instead. Although we were highly disappointed that we would not get the initial spa experience that we expected when booking, it was too short notice to make alternative arrangements and postpone or even cancel the treatments.

We spoke to the manager as soon as we arrived at the hotel, to express our frustrations and disappointment that no-one had even called us to tell us about the pool being out of action. He was sympathetic and arranged our afternoon tea as compensation for later on in the day.

After the pleasant treatments but a rather overall boring spa experience (not really the complete spa package that we had anticipated), we made our way to afternoon tea. We were pleasantly surprised that it was the chocolate afternoon tea that we would be getting, but our excitement was rather short-lived. The bread for the sandwiches was dry (ducks bread as reviewed by the previous reviewer on here!) and made it evident that they werent freshly made as was promised. The cakes were however delicious and we were looking forward to ending with the scones. On my second bite of the scone however, I bit into a stone (see attached pictures). The stone had been inside the scone and we couldnt believe our eyes. We called the waiter over straight away who tried to get hold of the chef but he couldnt find him. The Manager then came and explained that the scones were bought in from an external supplier, and that he would investigate further.

The Manager has been in touch to update us that the scone suppliers are sending the stone to a lab for a thorough investigation, so we are eagerly awaiting the findings.

Although the spa streatments were good, the poor customer service and shoddy afternoon tea experience really ruined this for us."

",,4 of 5 stars,"My sister and I went on a Saturday for a spa day with champagne afternoon tea experience (Virgin voucher). I went to the gym which was a reasonable size and really good modern machines with fantastic technology. I was on my own so had the whole room for myself!
After this I went to the spa which i knew was small as we had previously stayed in the hotel. The maximum it can take is 8 people as there is not much space to lie down and relax. We both had some treatments. Yes the treatments are a bit expensive but you are in the middle of London, hence you know what to expect!! The staff at the spa was ever so lovely, very attentive, always smiling, making sure we enjoyed our day. Yes there is a male beauty therapist but he knows exactly what he is doing (I can easily imagine you have to be qualified to work in those places!), he made sure we enjoyed our experience 100%. In conclusion, a very pleasant experience.
The afternoon tea was so lovely, highly recommended! A dozen tables were taken, but we never waited to get served. We had a very pleasant gentleman who was playing some music on a harp, this was ally relaxing. The food was lovely, with a mixture of sandwiches, cakes and scones. There was plenty to eat!
The staff at the hotel was ever so lovely, nice word, always smiling.
We ended our day with a detour by the champagne bar where we had a lovely cocktail."

",,2 of 5 stars,"My two friends and I came to have our spa treatments at Sanook spa for my pampering birthday weekend. Despite the initial issues we had encountered when booking our treatments (no-one in the spa answers the phone, no-one gets back to you when you leave messages, making it a nightmare to book treatments), we decided to give the hotel and spa the benefit of the doubt. Indeed, I wish we hadn't bothered.

My friend and I tried to ring the spa a few days before our visit to confirm our booking but as usual, couldn't get through and no-one called us back. My friend then emailed the spa and only received a reply a day before our visit, advising us that in fact the pool was out of order, but that we could have afternoon tea instead. My other friend had already arrived in London by the time we received this email (having travelled down 3 hours from the North). We had all taken annual leave off work so although we were highly disappointed that we would not get the initial spa experience that we expected when booking, it was too short notice to make alternative arrangements and postpone or even cancel the treatments and re-arrange our days off.

We spoke to the manager as soon as we arrived at the hotel, to express our frustrations and disappointment that no-one had even called us to tell us about the pool being out of action. He was sympathetic and arranged our afternoon tea as compensation for later on in the day.

The spa treatments were very good but it was an overall boring spa experience (not really the complete spa package that we had anticipated).There are only 2 massage therapists and 2 beds, so 2 of us were able to have our treatments at the same time and the other person was to go straight after. If the pool had been working, this wouldn't have been a problem but as it was out of order, it was rather boring for the 3rd person who had to hang around for an hour killing time.

We got a cheap Groupon offer which was good value for money but even so, I wouldn't book the spa again due to the poor lack of awareness of customer service. We should have been notified that the pool wasn't working in advance."

On their website is a picture of a comfortable mini van. Unfortunately when we were met at our hotel at 8am, we were greeted with a London taxi with forward and backward facing seats. We had scheduled for this day and had no option but to continue on our tour. This trip had a significant amount of driving. The backwards facing seats were not very comfortable particularly for the amount of travel time as well as being terrible for motion sickness which we all shared and took turns bearing the discomfort. We were absolutely exhausted (and a bit nauseous) when we returned. Unfortunately, an accident caused us to take a lengthy detour and in addition to our physical condition lead us to cancel going to Brampton. We would have arrived back at about 8pm and we could not take another minute in the taxi. Thus we lost a part of the tour as a result. I received an email 2 days after our trip from Catherine asking about our trip. When I responded and advised about the vehicle I received no response and it has been about 2 weeks, more than enough time to confirm my story and respond. Expecting a comfortable van especially when depicted in their website is not unreasonable. Getting a response from a reputable company is also not unreasonable yet this company failed on both accounts. Our guide was very knowledgeable but the travel experience greatly diminished our experience. I would not book with this company again."

On arrival, my sister and I were shown to the changing rooms, and then pointed in the direction of the spa facilities. We couldn't wait to see what they had on offer!

We quickly got changed (this proved a difficult task considering the changing space is tight at best) however not to be put off we made our way (with our magazines in hand) to the spa.

A dingy corridor led to 2 doors - we went through the first, to find a steam room (with a hosepipe sticking out of the floor), a sauna and a shower (to be honest my power shower at home is more impressive). Oh, and one of those bucket thingys to throw cold water over your head. All of this was squashed into a space of about 10x10 metres.

We sat in the sauna for a few minutes, hoping no one else entered (it would have been a squeeze), and headed off to find the pool.

Errrrrrr - what pool??? A 5 star spa with no pool? Disappointing.... Ok, we'll find somewhere to relax and read our magazines then.

Through the second door, and we were hit with 5 beds all within a few inches of each other, and all occupied. The room was tiny (my bedroom is bigger) and it felt awkward to say the least.

We approached a member of staff to ask what we were now supposed to do. Her reply? 'If you turn up after 1pm it's usually a bit quieter'.

We left after 10mins, queued for a shower, then queued to use a hairdryer, and headed to the bar, more stressed out than we had been when we arrived.

During our stay, we noticed 3 other people complaining, we wrote to the manager and surprise surprise had no reply. Not great from a 5 star establishment."

We are all old London hands. We all loved this tour.

The selling point for this tour is the guide(s) telling fun, funny stories about London. The catch is that at every stop, one of the stories is a porgy or lie. The goal is to try and determine which story is the porgy.

The tour we arranged for was of The Strand and it was enormously fun, entertaining and very informative. Our guide was a wonderful character named Pete.

I gather with larger groups, there can be two guides, which I would imagine makes the story telling more lively. Also, with larger groups I think that the guides divide up the group into teams to determine which story is a lie and which true. Among our threesome, we each, and Peter, took turns reading the truth and the lie and the rest of the gang voted on which we thought was true.

While I think the true/false story telling may work a bit better with a larger group, we nonetheless had a great time. The lies Peter told were completely entertaining. Indeed, I think I know a fair amount of English and London history, and I had difficulty picking out the porky on more than one occasion. Peter was really fun, kind, intelligent and excited to be showing off his city. He is a real wealth of knowledge and his enthusiasm was infectious even on a slightly wet, breezy and increasingly chilly November night (you can always stop at a pub before and/or after to warm up!).

As I said, we arranged for a tour of The Strand area  a part of London that none of us knew very well. Peter was a great guide telling the history  both large and small  of building, neighborhoods and the city. He is a true font of arcane and fun knowledge.

But the best part  and one Peter had in mind when we set the time  is that he had us crossing Waterloo Bridge at sunset. Ive been to London many times. I can tell you that Ive never seen a more impressive, wonderful vista of the city than that during our early evening crossing of Waterloo Bridge. It was magical  practically worth the price of admission on its own. If Id seen that sky in a painting  a Turner or Whistler, say  I wouldnt have believed it. And, thats a testament to the thoughtfulness of Peter and this tour: he knew there was a chance for magic and set things up to give us the best possible opportunity to experience it.

The charge for our 90 minute or so tour was 70 pounds (and I happily tipped another 20 pounds as we enjoyed it so much). The charge for a larger group is higher but economy of scale would also be on your side (I gather that a lot of tours/businesses, etc. use this tour as a opportunity for good-natured, fun team building).

I am recommending this tour to anyone visiting London who wants both personal attention and a tour(s) that is different than a bored guide stating the same thing over and over again. This tour was unique. I thought I knew and loved London pretty well, I know it  and like it  even better today as a result of this experience."

Jumping Jacks is a great place to bring the kids where they can play with soft toys, a massive bouncy castle, jigsaws, ride on cars etc, etc etc. everything is clean and although my son is five and loves the place, I saw lots of much younger children there, including babies that have their own area.

The ladies that run the place, are both lovely and welcoming, nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. They have an Expresso/Cappuccino machine behind a serving area and apart from making great coffees, they offer freshly made sandwiches and toasted paninis. They also do a ""Kids Box"" where you can have five items for a very modest price. I always get this for my son and he loves it. Prices are cheap for the area and the homemade sandwiches and home baked cakes are excellent.

Although we sat inside there is also an outside area which has been sectioned off to stop the kids disappearing. Tables and benches are outside and if its sunny the next time I go, I'll be sitting out there.

My son loves the place and while he plays, I can have a decent coffee and sit with other parents and make friends, you can't beat that. Loads of free parking just makes this a perfect morning or lunchtime activity and at 4.00 a visit, an absolute bargain."

She mapped the walk for us on a route planner and gave that to us so that we could replicate it again and again. It turns out we had walked 4 miles and we couldn't believe we had covered that much ground as she is so captivating you never noticed the time flying.

It was so charming to learn a bit about the history without stopping to hear a recited lecture.

There was no way to avoid the flight of concrete steps leading to the entrance, which my friend's frail mother had difficulty climbing. Once inside I asked whether there was a lift, or entrance for wheelchairs. The people at reception had no idea and called an employee who informed me that there were no disabled facilities at that branch, but someone requiring disabled access would have to go to their Hendon branch. I asked to speak to the manager, who eventually came to see me while we were having breakfast.
He also informed me that Hendon has disabled access and that if someone came to the Avenue they would send them to Hendon. I pointed out that the building is not listed and therefore by law adaptation should be made. They have not done so.
BOYCOTT THIS PLACE. They discriminate against the disabled."

I first went when I was experience some lower back pain and had a 3 great treatments and within a few days I felt like 100% - the guy that treated me was very well informed and really cared for my wellbeing.

Since this time I have been going regularly for Facials, Massages and Manicures  would recommend the sea breeze facial and the milk and honey wrap both are a piece of Haven on earth. The sea breeeze a actually ends with a cocktail sadly non alcoholic. The location in Notting Hill is great for shopping in the afternoon as I have ended many days here recharging my batteries for a night out plus you can order food in the chillout area from a great menu from Carluccios around the corner (I love this place).

Last week me and a group of friends had went to their new facial bar and had a great laugh  we brought our own champers and ended the night with masks made of banana and avocado it was to die for.

Well recommend and actual wish this place was my own lounge.

Hier ist es besonders das Outfit welches den besonderen Reiz der Veranstaltung ausmacht, aber auch die Besucher sind ausgeflippt. Ganz einfach  Die Kleidung muss zu den britischen Schuluniformen passen. Alles andere ist der individuellen Gestaltung berlassen. Schicke Accessoires und Schmuck sind natrlich erlaubt. Die Shirts und Blusen sollten dabei wei sein, die Hosen und Rcke am besten schwarz. Und eine schwarze Krawatte, sonnst geht gar nichts. Was in der School Disco abgeht bekommt man sicher in Deutschland nicht in der Party Scene geboten. Und das was sich hier teilweise abspielt ist nicht jugendfrei! In der School Disco geben die Leute scheinbar alle Hemmungen an der Tr ab. Es ist nicht ungewhnlich wenn manchen Besucher nur noch in Unterwsche umherlaufen.
Der Eintritt ist nicht ganz billig, also etwas mehr Geld einstecken und Spa haben. Alter erst ab 21+"

I told the staff I would call back if there were any issues as I needed to confirm my plans. They said that was fine. When I called back one hour later to cancel, I spoke to a different staff member and was told my credit card would be charged as there was a 24 hour cancellation policy.

There had been no mention of this policy when I made the booking, nor did they even take my credit card details, even though I told them I was a new customer. I asked to woman on the phone to confirm how she planned to take money from my account without my card details....she was furious, put me on hold for 5 minutes and came back and said...'congratulations, you were right. we don't have your card details, but I will ensure next time you book I will take them and charge you if you miss the appointment. You must be pleased with yourself.' I told her not to worry there wouldn't be a next time and she should really leave her attitude behind.

I will never ever book to go there again- I will stick with the charming Beauty Works West where the staff are always amazing, helpful and friendly and the treatments divine. Or Space NK, or Julie's Nail bar at Notting HIll Gate for a Mani/ Pedi."

I was very happy with the treatments and the standard of service so I decided to have a facial, after a consultation with the therapist we concluded a CACI Booster Facial was the best treatment for me at this stage.

Tour guides were friendly and knew a great pub for lunch in the back streets of Westminster. I would definitely do this again."

I thought I was fit, but this takes your fitness to another level! Don't be surprised if you feel light headed if you have never experienced hot yoga before but this does start to diminish the more times you go.

It turned out to be a great day out , learning all sorts of interesting facts about well-known landmarks but also discovering new places, even in a city I know well. The guide was very friendly and knowledgeable and the route safe and mostly traffic-free. The bikes are an unusual and eye-catching design, but very comfortable and easy to ride. Don't be worried if you're not much of a biker: the route is flat, the pace leisurely and you don't need to use the gears. Two of us were in our sixties but the biking was effortless. All in all, really good value for money and a superb way to spend time in the capital. Highly desirable for Londoners and absolutely essential for anyone else."

i love hatha yoga over other forms and finding bikram has been a revelation!

the best skin and flexibility you could ever have!!

and don't worry about the class being all perfect skinny minis - this is not that type of yoga centre or yoga practice, while people are kind and supportive, everyone is focused and non judgmental, they were all in your place once - the newbie and you are allowed to get along at your own pace

you will be amazed how quickly you will progress if you stick with it - getting over the sweat dripping off your nose like you are in a power shower within the first 10 minutes of the class

you do not have to worry about what you are wearing or how you look or compare yourself to others! just do it

you come out energised and exhilarated!!!

basically it is a hatha yoga class in the heat, no different than if you are on holiday in goa, miami, kerela, dubai, LA, rio or a caribbean island at the height of the summer and doing a class outdoors instead of an unhealthy air-conditioned studio - which i hate and would never do!!

and it makes sense as the heat gives you flexibility you did not know you had without the possibility of damaging yourself

this studio is perfect if you are just visiting london on holiday (what better time to start a regular practice when you do not have to rush to work) or if you are working, as it is so central and you can pop in for your 2 hours (you need a minimum of that if you want to properly shower afterwards and cool down - probably more if you are heading to the office and need to blow-dry your tresses to a work standard - i give myself 3 hours from entering the building to arriving where i have to be in the west end afterwards)

they have a great 14 day package for a traveller or a resident new starter of just 35 - so great if you are only stopping by briefly

remember to take photo ID on your first visit and come 30 minutes before the class to get your bearings and register

BIG TIP - when you decide you want to do this, start to hydrate your body before you start the programme - at least a week before - i go by dr batmanghelidj's recommended on the quantity of healthy fluids needed as outlined in the book - your body weight in pounds divided by 50 equals the number of litres you need for your body systems to function optimally, then for every half hour of exercise or half hour in a sauna an extra half litre, so when i do a bikram class i make sure i put an extra 1.5 litres of healthy fluids into my body, before, after and during the class, on top of my daily weight calculated allowance

i know you think this may be a lot, but try it your body and bladder will adjust after 10-14 days and you will naturally lose weight and bloat and have great skin on your face and tone on the rest of your body!

they sell water and coconut water (the only healthy fluids i put in my body bar herbal teas)

go along with a totally open mind, relax, give it a try and enjoy  and become bendier, more quickly than you ever thought


try it and every ache and pain in your body will stretch and melt away"
