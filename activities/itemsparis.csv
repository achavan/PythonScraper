I participated in a Versailles private tour with the Viator company and our tour guide was the effervescent, highly educated, extremely knowledgable and rapier witted Stephanie. Versailles is mind blowing and my words wouldn't provide it justice. Do yourself a favour and go and see this place before you kick the proverbial bucket.

Been to Paris 5 times before I managed a trip here - and it was worth the wait - lovely grounds, lovely palace. Ensure that you are prepared for queues when you get there though. Hard to believe this is in Paris. Eating here was not cheap but the food was pleasant.

Our tours & workshops embrace the culture and history of the Paris movement, and depending on whether youre walking or biking, the routes differ, but typically any tour will visit the main street art and graffiti zones in the north-east of Paris: Oberkampf, Mnilmontant and Belleville, also visiting a street art graffiti gallery, where you will be able to meet the artists in person, and ending where we will often see graffiti artists painting. We are known for being relaxed and informal, but also as experts in street art and we are friends of the artists, so our knowledge of the scene comes from the streets.

Not only did I enjoy discovering the 11th / 20th district, the tour guide, Antoine, was welcoming, very informative, paced the tour correctly and was a delight.
I knew nothing of street art before but now know of it's origins, artists, the area plus I notice more art on a daily basis.
Highly recommended.

They also do meat and cheese platters for those who want a lil something to eat.

This differs from most Parisian parks, in that it doesn't have the usual formality. Paths wander around the various features- bridges, limestone cliff, landscaped banks, wooded areas, lake and even a 'labyrinth' (don't expect a complex task!). Great place to take time out from the big city vibe.

It is an extremely pleasant surprise to find an Italian restaurant fully manned by Italians in a city where the use of multicultural staff is the norm.
They offer an excellent and varied menu with meat and fish specialties, and a wine list to suit.
It's a very small place, so reserve a table to avoid being disappointed.

Make a lunch reservation -- much cheaper than dinner -- and then soak in the over-the-top ambiance and service.
The presentation of the food is outstanding. The flavours are abundant and intense.
The whole experience is amazing. Truly a special meal.
Reservations in advance are a must. Just do it.
Mmmmmmm.
