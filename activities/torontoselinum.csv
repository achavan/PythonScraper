We had been greeted so nicely, and been explained how things work there.
The place is a long apartment and at the end of it, you discover this unique Nordic spa behind a heavy wooden door. It is small yet cosy with wooden walls. We had it for the 2 of us. What a feeling ! Plants, the sound of water, 2 chairs and a small table in between with a Russian tea, classy cups and a beautiful bouquet of roses. We had a basket with towels, water, slippers, bathrobe etc. We felt as we were in a romantic getaway and loved it! The sauna was so hot (with pine scented water) that it helped us jump in the frozen small pool(with rose petals). You can then relax and sip the hot Russian tea. What a perfect atmosphere for a good relaxation! It is really a clean, quiet and comforting place; a different way to experience a Nordic spa, as you don't have huge pools and large areas but no crowd either. Massage time came and I quickly realised I was having one of the best treatment I ever had. It is not easy to find a massage therapist who performs the way you like, and Irina was a gem for me (deep tissue, percussions, hot oil, and she finishes with a hot humid towel to wipe off the massage oil off your skin). Did I mentioned that under the massage table there was another bouquet of roses? Have you ever seen that before? When I was done, I would loved to have my bed right there. I have to point out that the music Irina puts is not the kind we are used to hear and that adds to the experience (Aretha Franklin, jazz, blues). I hope you will get a chance to experience something like that or to think about it to make someone happy."

Access to the spa also gives you access to the hotel jacuzzis and swimming pool which was lovely with plenty of sun beds and a great view of the mountains. A very nice place to spend a day. There was also a nice looking lounge so even if it was raining you could read and relax. They told us that in the winter the terrace is heated to keep it clear from snow - I would happily go back.

",,5 of 5 stars,"I have been to many spas in NY but this does not compare. I ordered an Aroma Polish that comes with a 30min scrub and Swedish massage, and added an essential facial. My technician Melanie was one of the best and had the softest hands I'd ever felt. She was petite, but she sure was experienced and for 3 hours, I'd forgotten about the rest of the world. She began the session with a 5 minute chat on problem areas, what I wanted her to work on, etc. She asked me about my comfort level of various areas (ie breast and buttocks). She made me feel so comfortable that it was never an issue. As she worked the scrub she felt around to see my areas of tension. After the scrub, she escorted me to the shower which she already had the water running and towels and fresh robes laid out. During the massage, she used her expertise to figure out my most stressed areas and I'm sure I fell asleep because before I knew it, the massage was over and she was moving on to my facial. The facial itself was relaxing as she kept my eyes covered even in bright light so it was never distracting to me. There was an enzyme leave on facial peel that she gave me at the end and I would have loved to purchase that item, but she said that was the one item that was for professional use only and could not be sold to me. Go figure! There was never any pressure to buy any of the products as she left me recommendations on a sheet and left it at that. She truly made my spa experience so relaxing. I would go back to Montreal just to find her! All in all, i would recommend this spa. If you've been to the Bliss Spa's that are in the W Hotel Chains you will love this one. It is the ONLY W Hotel that has it's own spa using products from France and Italy. This is a must go to spa if you're looking for a few hours of extreme bliss."

Jean (owner, boat captain & guide) is a very easy going, knowledgeable and patient individual, whose passion is fishing, and making sure that his customers enjoy every minute of the trip. His boat is well equipped (and very sparkly) and more than comfortable enough for a day on the very fast flowing waters of the St. Laurence river, targeting the fish that live in it.

We started off the day fishing for Sturgeon, and I was far from being disappointed, catching a 5 foot long perfect specimen, along with some smaller sturgeon and Walleye. To be honest I would've been happy calling it a day after catching the Sturgeon, but after a few hours we then headed further up river for a Bass fishing session. In all honesty, this was just as much fun, as it was fast paced fishing ,catching plenty of them, and they put up a very good fight for their size!!!

We had been greeted so nicely, and been explained how things work there.
The place is a long apartment and at the end of it, you discover this unique Nordic spa behind a heavy wooden door. It is small yet cosy with wooden walls. We had it for the 2 of us. What a feeling ! Plants, the sound of water, 2 chairs and a small table in between with a Russian tea, classy cups and a beautiful bouquet of roses. We had a basket with towels, water, slippers, bathrobe etc. We felt as we were in a romantic getaway and loved it! The sauna was so hot (with pine scented water) that it helped us jump in the frozen small pool(with rose petals). You can then relax and sip the hot Russian tea. What a perfect atmosphere for a good relaxation! It is really a clean, quiet and comforting place; a different way to experience a Nordic spa, as you don't have huge pools and large areas but no crowd either. Massage time came and I quickly realised I was having one of the best treatment I ever had. It is not easy to find a massage therapist who performs the way you like, and Irina was a gem for me (deep tissue, percussions, hot oil, and she finishes with a hot humid towel to wipe off the massage oil off your skin). Did I mentioned that under the massage table there was another bouquet of roses? Have you ever seen that before? When I was done, I would loved to have my bed right there. I have to point out that the music Irina puts is not the kind we are used to hear and that adds to the experience (Aretha Franklin, jazz, blues). I hope you will get a chance to experience something like that or to think about it to make someone happy."

After a few minutes, I was led to the locker room. There were a few nice touches, but it looked more like a fitness club locker room.

My treatment was done in a wet-room that had as much ambiance as a shower and a few candles could muster. The practitioner scrubbed the bamboo/lotus/water lily stuff onto my skin using very little oil. It was quite abrasive--in all the wrong places. My upper back was raw and painful for days afterward. She had an very 'perfunctory' approach and seemed interested in finishing and ended my 50 minute treatment almost 10 minutes early. That probably saved some of my skin! She walked very quickly when she led me to the lounge and the roughly tucked a blanked over my robe. I felt more roughed-up than relaxed.

On my way out, the practitioner was seated at the front desk. She told me to book a massage the next time rather than a treatment. Maybe they were just having a slow, winter, Montreal day. But I'd skip this place for a spa that trains its staff in customer service."

My technician Melanie was one of the best and had the softest hands I'd ever felt. She was petite, but she sure was experienced and for 3 hours, I'd forgotten about the rest of the world. She began the session with a 5 minute chat on problem areas, what I wanted her to work on, etc. She asked me about my comfort level of various areas (ie breast and buttocks). She made me feel so comfortable that it was never an issue. As she worked the scrub she felt around to see my areas of tension. After the scrub, she escorted me to the shower which she already had the water running and towels and fresh robes laid out. During the massage, she used her expertise to figure out my most stressed areas and I'm sure I fell asleep because before I knew it, the massage was over and she was moving on to my facial. The facial itself was relaxing as she kept my eyes covered even in bright light so it was never distracting to me. There was an enzyme leave on facial peel that she gave me at the end and I would have loved to purchase that item, but she said that was the one item that was for professional use only and could not be sold to me. Go figure! There was never any pressure to buy any of the products as she left me recommendations on a sheet and left it at that. She truly made my spa experience so relaxing. I would go back to Montreal just to find her! All in all, i would recommend this spa. If you've been to the Bliss Spa's that are in the W Hotel Chains you will love this one. It is the ONLY W Hotel that has it's own spa using products from France and Italy. This is a must go to spa if you're looking for a few hours of extreme bliss."

",,2 of 5 stars,"Honestly, i was extremely disappointed with my experience at the spa. Other than the great view at night of the city sky line, it was absolutely not worth it.

I found the facilities to be very dirty (so mch hair and other debris everywhere). I unfortunately forgot my flip flops and was cringing basically the whole time. There is absolutely no perks provided other than some harsh soap/shampoo and heavily scented lotion. At one point i found myself to be extremely thirsty and they has a jug of lemon water avaiable but you had to pay $5 for a dinky reusable cup under the guise of being exo-friendly. I have NEVER been to a spa that didnt have glasswear that was washable and reusable. Not to mention i just have never been to a spa period where i didnt have a choice of tea or various complimentary waters.

The water-circuit staff looked miserable and were unattentive. The counter staff mumbled something long and incoherent at the begining and that was that.

The view was nice but i am NEVER going back there again. I will be sticking to the Spa Scandinave where, for the same proce, you are made to feel as you should in a spa- special,looked after, and not excited to just shower and get clean.

Major bummer."

It was true, we were often alone in the saunas but the hot tubs were usually busy.

The spa is very unique I'm design. All do the spa is very relaxing and quiet the surrounding view does not offer this. A big run down industrial building right next to the spa. A cruise ship was boarding and leaving duri our visit. These are minor details that are not the spas faults. The views of Old Montreal are very nice.

The receptionist on the first floor was extremely rude and unprofessional, the entire boat is HOT which is not relaxing when it's already hot outside. They did not tell us that if we wanted to sit on the terrace(which is the nicest sitting are on the boat) we had to purchase the water circuit, it would have been nice if they told me that over the phone and not when I wanted to sit there. The massage was horrible, it was not a swedish massage, and I've had enough to know what a swedish massage should be. My friend was shocked when I told her we got swedish massages because it wasn't. The place is overpacked, way to many workers and guests stuffed in a small area. The locker rooms felt like I was at a cheap gym locker room. They smelled and the cleaning lady was trying to clean the area but there was no room for her or for the people that were there. I would not go back, I would rather spend my money at a different spa in the Old Port, there are plenty out there that are more professional, friendlier, and cleaner than this spa. Extremely overrated for what I experienced."

",,2 of 5 stars,"Went here as a deal on groupon. Called a week in advance to let them know we'd want to use the gym before the massage. The male receptionist said that it wouldn't be a problem, and that we could do things in whatever order we liked on arriving. On arriving, we were told that we HAD to have our massages at that exact time (on arriving), and that we could use all other facilities after. On telling them about what their receptionist had claimed, they didn't care and just pushed us to go forward with the massages. The massage was good except I felt somewhat tense throughout it because of the whole ordeal of not being able to go to the gym as mentioned before. The part of the package: The oxygen bar is right next to the receptionist's desk in the entrance. You literally sit there on display with green tubes hooked in your nose. Felt like the waiting room featured in the film Beetlejuice. We used the gym afterward because we wanted to work out and feel good before going in the pool. The pool is in a room with a low ceiling and it consists of two narrow separated lanes. One of the lanes is reserved for swimming laps. There is one jacuzzi next to the pool. When we were there, a couple was in it with their 2 year old son. It's ideal for people perhaps visiting and staying at the hotel.Women's locker/shower room had cracked ceilings, walls and pealing paint. On making an appointment with with them, make certain to be very clear about every thing."

The tour was presented in both english and french and the narrator transitioned seamlessly between languages. The tour was about 75 minutes and included about 45 minutes of driving though old Montreal and 30 minutes in the water. The guide did a great job of explaining the history of the area and the local landmarks. She mixed in some humor as well helping to create a more relaxed atmosphere.

Overall it was a good way to get familiar with the area and spend a little time on the water. I do wish they added a little more humor to the experience but realize that perhaps this area is a little more serious then the Boston area."

",,5 of 5 stars,My wife and I made a 10 am reservation on a Saturday for a 60 minute message and the water circuit. We had a total of 3 hours to relax onsite. It was heavenly. We took a nap in the hammocks in between going from the hot tubs/sauna/spas to the cold pools. We had nothing but a great experience with all of the staff. When our time was up 1 pm we had lunch onsite. Lunch was okay but we were just glad to extend our time on the boat. It did start to get more crowded after 12 but I still enjoyed the vibe. This will be a must do on my list everytime I visit Montreal. Feel free to bring a book to read while you relax.

It provided a great view of some major buildings of the downtown, and Nico continued with history and information about them. It was also great to move a bit out of the harbour and see the current of the St. Lawrence. I had no idea it was so strong!

Couple of tips - it's worth phoning in advance to reserve your spot - they do fill up some times. They don't take payment until you show up to get your ticket. Also the pickup/dropoff is right on the edge of old Montreal, so it's a great opportunity to go wandering afterwards to experience the cafes, art galleries, etc."

One tip I can give those planning to take this tour is try sitting on the left side of the bus for the land; I found most of the interesting stuff was on that side (thats if they're taking the same route leaving from the science centre).

The tour takes off from Old Montreal by land . It travels around the city for a while . The tour guide speaks both English and French . The unique part was going into the water . I would say do it but dont expect too much .

We were told that Crescent Street is where to go during Formula One week in Montreal. We went on the first day and it sucks for us that it rained the day we went, but it just felt like the hype for Crescent Street was very short lived.

These days tourists do tons of research before they go to a restaurant. But every once in a while we want to do it the old fashioned way. Just walk up to a restaurant, look at the menu and ambiance, and make a decision. Crescent street is the perfect place to do that. We had our first meal in Montreal...

We had done a Duck Tour in San Francisco and loved it, so we thought this would be similar. We were wrong. We did not have the boat painted like a fish in the picture, but the yellow and blue one instead. The windows barely opened a crack (unlike the other boat) so we were burning up the whole time. There was some interesting information shared on the tour and our tour guide was funny. But it was hot, there was not much to see from the windows, and we got stuck in some intense traffic. I would not do this again and would never recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal."

",,4 of 5 stars,"We recently went on the Amphibus tour in Montreal and were not disappointed. We bought tickets at the booth near the Science Museum and were advised that the tour left in around an hour, so we went for a coffee nearby and came back around 15mins before the tour started as advised.

The tour is pretty good and covers most of Old Montreal and the Harbour area, although it doesn't go into Chinatown or Mont Royal areas, which was fine as we visited them on foot later in our visit to the city.

The guide was very knowledgable and threw in some humour as well. The trip is done in both French and English which can be off putting at times - I don't know how frequent the tours are but ideally there could be alternate trips fully in French and English?

It was great to see the city from the water, as other than on top of Park Mont Royal it is probably the best spot in the city to get photos of the Montreal skyline. There is also a good view of Habitat 67 and the islands."

",,3 of 5 stars,"I was in Montreal for the Canada day long weekend and had planned to do this tour from the get go. The prospect of being able to travel both on land and water was enticing and we were greatly anticipating the trip. Although enjoyable, after walking away, I couldn't help feeling that there could have been more.

Initially, we planned on doing the regular open-air bus tour, but upon arriving at the Amphibus tours kiosk, we were sold on the idea of doing a night tour with fireworks. Fireworks while sitting on the water sounded like an awesome idea, but a few hitches prevented it from being as enjoyable as it could have been.

After leaving the dock, we proceeded directly towards the water. During this time the tour guide provided us with some interesting info about the surrounding buildings of the old port. The guide was young, but seemed to know his stuff and did a decent job. Montreal is beautiful from the water, especially at night, so for anyone looking for something romantic to impress a date, this might do it. However, my major complaint is that when we got into position for the fireworks, we had to wait over 30 minutes for it to begin. The crew also seemed a bit disorganized in that they themselves were not sure when the fireworks were to begin nor what channel to turn the radio to listen to the musical accompaniment. This is because the fireworks are actually part of some competition at La Ronde's and there was no coordination between that and the tour group. Anyway, that did not ruin the entire experience, but less waiting and more touring would have been better.

After the fireworks, we returned to land, made a quick loop of the city and returned to our starting point. Although the info provided was interesting, most of our time was spent on the water, which leaves little time to really see Montreal. That's probably the main reason I feel this tour is lacking. Compared to tours in New York and Chicago, I felt like I learned little about Montreal.

If you're someone who likes to learn a lot of in depth info about the history of a city, I'm not sure I can recommend this tour. If however, you just want to see a few sights close to harbour, especially from the water, the info is not half bad and the sights are beautiful, so give it a shot."

As a local, I have to say that Crescent Street is now over-rated. For a long time it was ""the"" place to go (for English drinkers), and the reputation was well deserved. Now, it is an area of average quality pubs (both drink and food average), with over-priced beer and other drinks. Yes, the pricing is ""market"" in that most...

Most of the bars are nothing special and indistinguishable. It reminded me of a cleaner and smaller version of Bourbon Street, Key West or the Upper East Side or Midtown Manhattan. The food options late at night are limited. If I was 25-years old again, it might have been better.

We were very fortunate to book with Jean in Montreal. He responds quickly via email and was able to set a date and arrange the license on our behalf and took a deposit via paypal.

His boat was located right in Old City with plenty of parking available nearby. The boat was very clean and comfortable. Jean took us on the river to fish for Sturgeon, Bass and Walleye. Everyone was able to catch fish and had a great time. Jean was patient guide and showed us the best way to fish the river and kept an eye out to make sure everyone was doing it right. He has a great personality and really knows where to find the fish.

As people who have fished with guides before, we would highly recommend a trip with Jean."

Once you cross it go two more blocks and hang a left. You've found the market. Not only do they have mountains of fresh produce but stands that sell everything from apple cider to full meals. We picked up some syrup and cider for far cheaper then some of the stores in the downtown were offering it. Even if you don't plan on buying produce, many of the vendors offer free samples to enjoy.

It is located in a beautiful hotel, Le Crystal, in Montreal, but the quality of this spa does not match its location. I had the intensive package, in the end my bill was about $300 with tax & tip. I left a spa for my first time ever feeling disappointed, not rejuvenated. Firstly, the hot tub, sauna and pool is shared with the hotel, so kids, families and large groups were accessing it at the same time. Secondly the bathroom/shower area lacked everything from shampoo to toilet paper. The treatments I received were a body scrub, a wrap and a facial. I have to say the lady I was with was very friendly, but she was a massage therapist, not an esthetician, and she said she would 'try her best'. So that made my scrub really great, but the wrap awkward and facial basically like a light face wash and application of moisturizer. It was supposed to be about 2 hours and actually was a bit over an hour. I paid, and left, not feeling like the bill was justified. So the next week I called izba spa, and asked to speak to the manager to suggest that if these treatments were going to be given by someone who had not received appropriate training then the customer should be notified of this beforehand. The manager never did not return my two phone calls or my email. So my suggestion, avoid disappointment and go somewhere else."

All things mushrooms...ceramic mushrooms, fabric mushrooms, books on mushrooms, mushroom clothing, mushroom jewelry, classes on mushrooms, fieldtrips to collect, cooking with mushrooms.
Then the mushrooms themselves. Fresh Morels! I haven't found those in decades, living in Florida, but they were good quality, reasonably priced, and made pasta carbonara that night a really exotic treat! They have many kinds fresh, many more dried, and they sell several types of dried mushroom powder that can be used in baking, soups, you name it.
The proprietor--a gentle and courteous man, straight from central casting for a mushroom store owner--greets you warmly as you enter. His English is not perfect, but is far better than my French, but we had no trouble communicating, and his love and knowledge of mushrooms is apparent in any language.

He knew every cd in the store and could tell you right away if they carried something you were looking for.

L'offre tait la suivante:
http://www.vieurbaine.com/Deal/1374.
79$ donc, pays via sur Vie Urbaine, pour le forfait. Normalement le prix d'un trs bon massage d'une heure dans un endroit luxueux.

Je ne fais pas de caprices quand j'achte un forfait sur ce genre de site, parce que je sais que ce n'est pas hyper rentable pour le commerce visit, mais tout de mme, on s'attendrait  un minimum de professionnalisme. Aprs tout, ce genre d'offre vise  faire connaitre une entreprise, alors il faut faire en sorte que le client ait envie de revenir...

 mon arrive, il a sembl qu'on tait embt et qu'on ne savait pas trop o commencer pour le forfait. Pourtant, j'avais rserv une semaine  l'avance en mentionnant l'offre achete.

Pour le facial offert, on m'a fait diffrents soins du visage et suggestions pour soigner ma peau, et aprs on m'a dit que ma ligne de sourcils ainsi que le duvet au-dessus de ma lvre suprieure devraient tre faits  la cire. Pendant le traitement donc, on m'offre de les faire sans jamais mentionner que a ne fait pas partie du soin qui est en cours. J'accepte, et en moins d'une minute, je dpense (sans le savoir!) la jolie somme de 27$. Ma ligne de sourcils, qu'on me dit toujours impeccable, se retrouve beaucoup trop mince d'un ct, et -oh horreur!-, on me coupe les sourcils  coups de ciseaux! Moi qui les ai courts et dlicats, ce n'tait vraiment pas ncessaire, et a leur donne un air tout rches!

Ensuite, pour la manucure, eh bien, ce fut bref: aucune crme, aucun soin de la peau, rien que quelques coups de bton repouse-cuticules sauvagement assns (on m'a fait trs mal sans broncher ni arrter quand je l'ai exprim), et on me mentionne qu'on n'est pas suppos pour ce forfait de s'occuper des cuticules. Ensuite: quelques coups de lime et couches de vernis qui ne tiendront pas la journe avant d'tre  moiti dcolles (et pourtant, j'ai des ongles toujours impeccables que je ne maltraite point.)

La pdicure est correcte: lger massage des pieds aprs un bain et vernis qui tiendra longtemps. Le traitement d'aqua-massage est bien aussi.

Pour le massage final, on ne me demande ni mes prfrences, ni si je souhaite le massage sudois ou thrapeutique (choix pourtant mentionn dans l'offre), et on oublie la principale rgion o j'ai du stress et que j'ai besoin de voir masse (et je l'avais mentionn): la nuque. :(

Enfin, quand arrive le moment de payer, j'ai une trs trs mauvaise surprise: on me charge 70$ pour: les taxes sur le forfait  79$ qui en vaut prtendument 186$, l'pilation  la cire charge sans le mentionner (et on a le culot d'inscrire ""cration de sourcils"" sur la facture!), et, la cerise sur le gteau: 15% DE POURBOIRE SUR LA ""VALEUR"" TOTALE DES SOINS!!! Directement factur! Je n'aurais jamais d accepter de payer ces surplus, mais j'tais tellement estomaque que j'en ai perdu mes moyens, et j'ai pay. Et je me suis sentie totalement arnaque.

Je laisse habituellement des pourboires gnreux quand je suis bien servie, et le taux normal le reste du temps, et je ne me considre pas une cliente difficile, mais ici j'ai pay trop cher pour le genre de service que j'ai eu, et je ne retournerai pas  cet endroit."

Luckily for them, there are no inspectors for spas in Montreal. The place was dinghy, gloomy and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in months! The furniture was old and ragged under the worn face cloths that they used to cover the seating. The receptionist lacked character (like the place). When booking i asked if we could replace the sauna with fish foot bath. They said just mention it to the receptionist. When we arrived the receptionist's initial reaction was that this was not possible. She also mentionned that the swedish massage included the back exfoliation in the 60 minutes. The coupon alludes otherwise. The massage was great. HOWEVER at no point during the booking were we asked if we wanted male or female masseurs. (Most professional establishments will ask so as to give you an option). I would have preferred a female, however that has never deterred me from getting a massage. They only informed us when we arrived that they would be men. Having said that, both my friend and I felt we had great massages and felt great afterwards. The exfoliation was a joke. Not like going to an Aveda spa or anything. I think they just use a loofah glove or something. The dr fish foot spa was an interesting experience! But totally useless.. the fish do not eat away at dead skin... You come out with softer skin cause you've been soaking for 30 minutes! My callouses etc were all still there. Its a novelty thing that some girlfriends can do for fun but is not as permanent as a tatoo! The foot ionization is total complete utter snake oil! I knew that going in but i thought i would humour the establishment. After 15 minutes my friend and i had had enough. What bothers me is that establishments in Montreal can get away with that kind of turn of the century travelling medecin man treatments and get a way with it! The worst part is that since having it (they put a belt around your waist which heats up like a heating pad - hot enough to have left a heat rash on my friends lower back, hook you up at the wrist and run some sort of current or electrolytes through our system as you feet soak in water.. total poppycock just read the net) i have been experiencing severe lower abdominal cramping.. am hoping its just cause i am pre menopausal and not related to having this weird belt around my waist!!!! Save your dollahs and go to a real massage therapist and skip the rest.. as for the fishies, once you get past the 7 minute mark, the novelty wears off... whatevs... my friend an i spent a fun day out anyways!

I read previous reviews and they are right...that russian girl at the frontdesk is just mot meant to be there, she does not want to do anything, no smile, no coffee/th or anything....she does maje sure that the tiip and taxes are NOT included in the $39 1 hour massage and 30 minutes infrared sauna..then back to her pc screen she went...

We have not seen anyone else in the premises, the place looks like a redesigned appartement and very cheap looking...we were sitting in the window of the reception with a BIG RED FLASHING NEON sign advertising colon hydrotherapy...a bit weird!!!

After a while we were brought to our separate room, I waited about 10 minutes before ""Oleg"" showed up, he started what I can only describe as a "" I have done this all day Dude, don't expect too much massage"" , you would think that being massaged by a man would be the very least vigourous, I am not very muscular but it felt as if he thought he would break me...no pressure, no strenght, it was as if I have spent 45 minutes ( it was suppose to be 1 hour, but quite frankly, it started to annoy me) being carressed rather than massaged...

Last ""caresse"" and in a flash Oleg disappeared after abruptly stopping and saying "" it's done""...

I was left alone in the room without any directives, no bathrobe, I had to dress back up with an oily body, i stepped out and was told to enter a appartement size bathroom with a corner shower and a toilet right in front of the infrared sauna...where my boyfriend was already seated, in a bathrobe!!! It was as if we were in our own bathroom at home....

Now you got to understand that I payed only $39/ each "" tips and taxes are not included you know"" and was not expecting a high fashionnable welcoming Spa but this was at the bottom of the spa experience...

I am not sure if the receptionnist read my disapointed face because she offered me a "" fidelity card""...REALLY!!! I rather eat glass and clean my nails with a rusty nail than show my face in there!!!!"

I reserved a package (Nordic spa and massage) for hubby and me.
We had been greeted so nicely, and been explained how things work there.
The place is a long apartment and at the end of it, you discover this unique Nordic spa behind a heavy wooden door. It is small yet cosy with wooden walls. We had it for the 2 of us. What a feeling ! Plants, the sound of water, 2 chairs and a small table in between with a Russian tea, classy cups and a beautiful bouquet of roses. We had a basket with towels, water, slippers, bathrobe etc. We felt as we were in a romantic getaway and loved it! The sauna was so hot (with pine scented water) that it helped us jump in the frozen small pool(with rose petals). You can then relax and sip the hot Russian tea. What a perfect atmosphere for a good relaxation! It is really a clean, quiet and comforting place; a different way to experience a Nordic spa, as you don't have huge pools and large areas but no crowd either. Massage time came and I quickly realised I was having one of the best treatment I ever had. It is not easy to find a massage therapist who performs the way you like, and Irina was a gem for me (deep tissue, percussions, hot oil, and she finishes with a hot humid towel to wipe off the massage oil off your skin). Did I mentioned that under the massage table there was another bouquet of roses? Have you ever seen that before? When I was done, I would loved to have my bed right there. I have to point out that the music Irina puts is not the kind we are used to hear and that adds to the experience (Aretha Franklin, jazz, blues). I hope you will get a chance to experience something like that or to think about it to make someone happy."

When we walked in here, it was just a casual thing - by passing. But this place made us decide that we wanted to do a little tradition by getting an ornament from every city we were to visit.

Though a little bit small, there were amazing things all around - and maybe it's good that it's small otherwise it might have been overwhelming.

Even though I got my ornament from Montreal, I will be going back to get more and more."

They first took me to the ionic spa. Believe me, this is a scam. They put your feet inside a small bath of salted water and add an electrode that is supposed to ""bring all the bad toxins out of your body"". What it does is actually electrolyze the water. This corrodes the iron electrodes in the foot bath. Rust is what turns the water yellow then brown, nothing else. The massage was very different from what was advertised. I had many swedish massages in my life and this was nothing like it. The massage therapist didn't speak a word of french or english so she couldn't understand what I actually wanted. What she did was rubbing my skin really fast, and massaging it in small and agressive strokes. My skin was very warm at the end and my muscles still tense. Finally, the receptionist had to remind the ""therapist"" that there was an exfoliation included in the package. She scrubbed my already very sore back in less that 30 seconds and let me wash myself afterwards with a hand towel. She looked as if she was in a hurry and was sighing every 2 minutes.

My dad and husband had massages which they enjoyed, and my sister and I spent the day going from sauna to pool to lounge. Very relaxing and a wonderful way to spend a day! Would highly recommend.

I have had the opportunity to be treated to some grooming by some of the best barber shops in Canada (Ex: Truefitt & Hill in Toronto or Momentum Grooming in Vancouver). Gentlemen, mark my words, Anne-Marie, who took care of me, provided the best shaving I have ever experienced. She masters this unique and forgotten tradecraft and handles the straight razor like a skilled master. There are simply not enough barbers left who master such an art. A true perfectionist with delicate finesse, Anne-Marie is a true artist. Gentlemen, take note. As for MANN, you have a hidden gem in your hands. Kindest regards!"

Outdoor spas, finish sauna and steam room were perfect. The massage service and treatments were very expensive and average at best. A 50 minute massage was $109.23!

Horrible Customer Service. I did not feel welcome at all. My Colon Hydrotherapist did not speak a word of english or french, so my many questions went unanswered. All he did was grunt. The receptionist had a very aggressive, unfriendly demeanour. Needless to say, I walked out without getting my treatment.

We went there and there are two stations for Docteur Fish. So I was able to enjoy with my boyfriend a new experience the tickeling of the small fish and reading my book I was able to relax. There is no music but for me it is a distraction. I like to read quietly.

Il n'y a pas de local o mettre ses effets personnels et on ne vous donne pas de robe de chambre.

Mauvais service  la clientle, intrieur des annes 1990, musique d'ambiance seulement lors du massage et sortant d'une radio de mauvaise qualit.

Il faisait aussi trop froid dans l'immueuble. Les massothrapeutes ne parlaient mme pas franais.

La rceptionniste mentionne deux fois que le pourboire n'es pas inclu, et elle demande mme de laisser quelque chose  la fin.

Vraiment le pire spa o je suis all de toute ma vie."

La dcoration horrible. J'y suis alle en plein hiver avec mes bottes. J'ai d enlever mes chaussures (jusque l c'est normal) pour marcher sur le tapis...o finalement tout le monde marche avec ses bottes d'hiver (imaginez vous a ?). L'isolation sonore de la salle de massage oubliez cela, on entend tout ce qui se dit dans les salles d' ct (j'ai d'ailleurs eu un fou rire quand j'ai entendu la voix de mon amie lol).

Le massage : la rceptionniste m'a demand si je prfrais un homme ou une femme par contre elle n'a pas pos la question  mes amies qui taient arrives en retard. Le masseur tait trs bien (mais j'ai connu mieux quand mme). Il n'a pas eu de gestes indlicats.

L'exfoliation du dos : je la dcrirai comme tant nergique ! Le masseur ne m'a pas prvenu du coup comme c'tait froid c'tait super dsagrable.

Le sauna : je ne m'attendais pas  a. C'est tout petit. Aucun intrt.

La pdicure Fish : on voulait le faire ensemble avec mes amies. Nous tions  trois pour un bac... Trs peu de poisson, pour ma part ils m'ont bien bouff lol. Idem pas de serviette pour s'essuyer...enfin nous avons utilis celle que nous avions ramen !

J'ai eu mon reu pour les assurances sans problmes par contre mon amie a constat que le nom apparaissant sur le sien n'tait pas conforme au nom que lui avait donn son masseur.

Pour moi c'tait la premire et la dernire fois. Les services n'taient pas vraiment  la hauteur."

",,1 of 5 stars,"Premirement,  notre arriv la rceptionniste a pris plusieurs minutes avant de finalement nous accueillir (si on peut appeler a ainsi). Elle ne semblait pas comprendre lorsqu'on lui parlait et avais de la misre  s'exprimer. En gros: dcor mdiocre, personnel non qualifi, ambiance aucunement relaxante, gros manque organisation. Par exemple: le personnel entre et sort a tout moment pendant les soins ce qui empche la relaxation, pour nous essuyer les pied aprs le happy fish la rceptionniste nous a donner 2 morceaux de PAPIER ESSUI TOUT !! Et pendant la sance elle est venu 2 fois donner des coup de pied sur les bassins  poissons en riant RIDICULE!!!! Et c'est sans parler du massage !!!!!!!!! Le pire massage de ma vie a moi et ma copine!!!!! Les masso n'taient certainement pas qualifi et n'avait apparemment aucune exprience! En gros un massage qui tirait sur la peau par manque d'huile, aucune musique, geste brusque et trop fort n'importe ou et n'importe comment, chambre minuscule toujours entrain de m'accrocher la tte et tout au long du massage on pouvais entendre le personnel parl trs fort !!!

Finalement  notre sortie ils on eu l'audace de nous demander du pourboire pour les masseuses nul.
Je lui est rpondu que nous n'tions pas satisfait et nous somme partie!

Bref nous avons encore plus mal dans le corps que avant le massage!!!! Svp ne gaspillez pas votre argent a cette endroit !!!!! MEDIOCREEEEEE !!!!!!"

If you're looking for clubs, discotheques, and want to party with friends, this is the spot. Very popular with the locals and visitors. Great place to watch fancy limousines drive by with party goers.

This is the street where many of the bars are located. In the evenings, this street is completely different feel and you can feel the energy of this vibrant city. Check it out. They have all sorts of bars and restaurants on this street.
