The musical hall is convenient located in downtown core, so it is very easily accessible to many downtown office folks for after work shows, and students via C-Train.

This was the first year we purchased a park pass for Heritage Park. And I have to say, it was so worth the money. We didn't go every weekend, but we went a lot.
The kids loved the rides and the train. As well as exploring the past by peeking into teepees and forts.
And don't forget Ghoul's Night Out....

First of all - gentleman who works there ( I believe Denis is his name ) is amazing. He greeted us, told us ( shortly ) about museum, along with few guidelines on certain expo's. You can tell he loves what he is doing! I learned so much about Canadian involvement in military mission and also a lot about women...

The river pathways extend east to west along the Bow River and follow the Elbow all the way to Fish Creek Park in the south of Calgary. These wonderful pathways lead one through park lands and urban areas lined with benches to sit and admire the view and stop for a snack. The pathways are shared by everyone: walkers, strollers,...

Marked trail ways throughout the city are easy to find and indeed one good trail is from Heritage Park following the river back to downtown, about 12 km, but well worth it and mainly on the flat.

It's a great big party! Midway, beer gardens, musical events, amazing BBQ, pancake breakfasts and of course....rodeo. This event has been Calgary's go to attraction for most of the city's history and with good reason. Many of the big businesses go to minimum manning so that everyone can get out and get their stampede on!

We had never been to a stampede before so didn't really know what to expect. Calgary Stampede is the one to go to! We had an amazing time watching the stampede, the showmanship and expertise of the men and women were amazing. Afterwards there's a huge fair so you can spend many hours wandering around. There are also night time...

This river makes Calgary. It's fast-flowing and beautiful any time of year with ample fishing, wildlife and birds on its banks. There are walking/cycling/rollerblading trails for miles and miles on each side of the river with lots of interesting neighbourhoods and coffee/lunch stops along the way. Fall is particularly lovely with sunny breezy days and leaves changing colour. Don't miss...

Whether you are on foot or on a bike, the Bow River trails are great!
You can go for miles and not see the same thing, and the plus of the trails are, you can take one trail up one side of the River, and another trail on the other side of the river coming back....complete different perspective!

The Calgary Zoo is exceptionally well designed for people and animals alike.The setting is attractive, the food good (try to miss the heart of the lunch hour) and mercifully, they have kiosks for coffee and ice cream distributed around the grounds.
