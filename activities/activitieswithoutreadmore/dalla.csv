Met some great people and had some fantastic food with a nice walk through a safe, clean and attractive neighbourhood. Many different varieties of food to taste and there is an option to purchase cocktails. Highly Recommended.

This is a more expensive tour company, but it is well worth it. They spend extra time training you on the Segway, which is important. We had an awesome tour guide, Cyndi.

This cute trolley system is really a gimmick (you don't need a trolley to get around Uptown) but that said, it is fun and adds to the charm of the area. Also very cheap (I think it might even be free). A great way to get from one end of Uptown to the other without getting blisters. :)

Sorry, I don't get the McKinney Avenue trolley. Never have. It doesn't go anywhere interesting. It doesn't go very far so you can't really use it as a viable means of transportation. If you are really itching to ride an old trolley car, then maybe it is worthwhile. Otherwise, it is just a silly waste of time and money. How...

This is a more expensive tour company, but it is well worth it. They spend extra time training you on the Segway, which is important. We had an awesome tour guide, Cyndi.

The Dallas Farmer's Market has been a tradition here for years. You can get farm-fresh fruits and vegetables right off the truck (be sure you are dealing with a FARMER and not a DEALER -- their stands should be marked accordingly!)
Oh . . . and the nurseries at the Dallas Farmer's Market at top-rate! And the prices are fabulous....

Great for fresh fruit and vegetables. Fairly empty most of the time, and obviously weekends are more lively and full.

We've been shopping at the Farmer's Market for 30 years and love it. It has improved every year. You can talk to the farmers who actually grew the produce you're buying, although not every seller grew what he's sellling. And you can taste just about everything. There are also plants for sale and garden supplies, all at very good prices....

My wife and I recently visited Dallas and decided to try this food tour since it was so highly recommended on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. Not only was the food superb at the five places we stopped at, but Vanessa our guide was awesome. Food Tours should do whatever they have to do keep her on the job....
