The fun part? They send you an e-mail with the password to use for the WiFi, which of course you can't access without a connection.

The word Asakusa and Sento attract me. Last month I visited Asakusa at night I went this Jakotsu-yu. It was very cold. And after strolling Asakusa, my body was very cold. Jakotsu made not only my body but also my heart warm. And at the bathroom we can see carps! It was very amazing to take bath seeing Mt Fuji...

Tucked away in an alleyway, this establishment is over 100 years old, but the facilities are modern and clean. After dipping in one of the hot baths, or the chilled plunge bath, one can sit and contemplate while watching the waterfall or koi pond.

Signed up for the day trip for JPY11,000. Without the expensive lunch and expensive bullet train ride.
One tip though, if possible, please check the local weather forecast before booking the day tour, it definitely increases the chances for you to capture the million dollar view, which we fortunately saw today.
Thumbs up for Gray line tour!

Don't be turned away by the building as Erawan is located on the fourth flour above a Pachinko Parlor. Once you step through the doors you feel like you have entered Thailand.

Really glad we went to the game!

We got tickets for the all star game thru japanball and glad we did as it was worth every penny to attend this sold out event. Tickets were delivered to my hotel, getting to the game was easy and the crowds were amazing with 6 teams having players participating. Drums, flags, bugles, chants, towels, little umbrellas, banging sticks, these fans...

I don't think there is a bad seat in this stadium, although the most happening area is clearly the bleachers with organized fan groups playing music and chanting throughout the game.
The stadium itself is older, and has a good selection of food etc. But (as I found out) you can also bring your own food and drink into the...

Can be a little hard to find the simulator (is there anything easy to find in Tokyo?) but once you find it prepare to swing. Decently priced you can get 3 games of 20 hits for 1000 yen. Great fun and really something cool if you come from a place without a baseball cage.

Forego the nicer seats behind home plate and along the infield. Your best bet, like the Bleacher Bum seats of Wrigley field, are in right field.

The New Otani is as big as a small town. 20+ restaurants (try Ransen if you have big budget), small supermarket, post office, , pharmacy, book store, clinic, gardens, fashion boutiques, art galleries; you could check in an never leave the grounds.

The lunch was brilliant - very pleasant surprise. Cycling around Tokyo is a cinch! No better way to do it than with these engaging guides - brilliant!

This was a lovely cruise from Odaiba to Asakusa which takes one hour with one stop for about 5 mins. And then off to Asakusa. Yes, it will cost triple the price of a rail pass but worth the price of a fancy boat if you have the time...
Once in Asakusa, you may explore the temples and crowds at...

Went to Asakusa metro station - the Tokyo Cruise offices are just across the road next to the water. There are English speaking employees on hand to help you with timings/routes and purchase of the tickets from a machine. We chose the Akakusa to Odaiba journey which took about 50 minutes and cost Yen1560 each. Suggest you take a seat...

You should see to it that you take the early boat i.e. 09:00  10:00 ish.
It is always very crowded. Alternatively, there is a dinner cruise, which is highly recommendable, but it will cost about USD 150.-
The one that we would recommend is Sumida line excursion, which starts from Asakusa harbour and the boat cruises under many bridges...

My husband and I were planning on going to Asakusa from Shiodome (Himarikyu Gardens) anyway and thought it would be a nice way to see more of the city, rather than taking the metro. It was a nice day and so was a more interesting way to get to Asakusa, but I wouldn't recommend it as an attraction in itself.

If you want to check out Asakusa and Tokyo, Tokyo, this is the best way to bridge the two places. I was a bit wary about taking this cruise because it is over-promoted (in almost every Tokyo tour) and it doesn't have food (unlike the Tokyo Bay cruise).

I would take this ferry from the lovely gardens in Hama Rikyu to Asakusa as a break from walking. But be prepared for a rather dull journey as the commentary lists the names of faceless bridges.
It comes to life when you arrive at Asakusa and gain a fine view.
The view from the bridge at Asakusa is better though....

Not only can you see shows and sports games here, there is an amusement park (with a roller coaster going through a hole in a building), good food (Moomin cafe and a buffet restaurant), and shopping. It looks beautiful at night also, and it's near Ueno and Tokyo...

I was on a business trip to Tokyo and a meeting got cancelled giving me time to visit the bathhouse. I got it at 11AM.
As soon as I saw the bathhouse from the teleport station, I realized that I was in for a treat. I went to the onsen alone and I am not Japanese. Everything is really well...

it's funny to go and try it but it's nothing like the real place. They try to recreate a traditionnal Japanese village; it feels more like a theme Park but onsen is nice and it's good stop for a day trip in Odaiba.

There are some places one visits in order to get a taste of tradition and history. No doubt many onsens in Japan are like that, but this one isn't! From my point of view, the Oedo Onsen Monogatari is the Disneyland of onsens, full of pizzazz and ta-dahs, and, taken as such, is an absolute blast.
The onsen consists of...

This is part amusement park and part traditional Onsen (Japanese Hot Springs), but if you're not a stickler for an ""authentic"" experience, it is a great way to spend an afternoon or evening.

We saw this one and spent our time waiting for our hotel check in. We were hot bothered and frazzled and the cat cafe calmed up
Well loved rescued cats and a delightful owner
Highly recommend

I've seen a lot of Japanese shrines but this one was extra breathtaking if your down for a stroll. The grounds the Shrine is inside of are beautiful and yet eerie peaceful at the same time. We took our time and walked the whole park on our way to Hirajuku fashion area. This builds up a good apatite for lunch...

A nice peaceful spot in the city. Even if you are in Tokyo for business, this is very easy to get to. You can buy charms and votive boards there. i think it might be an active temple so you should be respectful and cover your shoulders. It is free but access to the garden is 500 yen.

This rambling space is a beautiful garden and Shinto temple. Walking through the grounds and down the many paths is so peaceful, while listening to birds chirp, seeing huge black butterflies flit from flower to flower, and occasionally catching glimpse of a priest or other religious person. This park does have a souvenir shop and a cafe and a restaurant....

The shrine and the garden surround it were beautiful, and relaxing. Close to Harajuku area, but the place is so relaxing and peaceful, a great way to escape from the bustling neighbourhood. You can also learn more about Emperor Meiji from the big baliho along the way to the shrine, a very good information if you like history lesson.

It is a good twenty minute walk from the entrance to the main Shrine. The walk takes you along a wide path through a quite densely wooded park away from all of the noise of Tokyo. There is a restaurant, tea room and toilets along the way.

The cooking class with Yuka was an excellent experience.
I not only got to know some secrets of the Japanese cuisine but I was also very happy to have somebody really professional by my side. A highly recommended activity to anyone who wishes to know more than a guide book could ever tell.
Thank you for this unique and unforgettable...

Great atmosphere - commercial hustle & bustle coupled with the central role fresh fish plays in Japanese culinary culture. Walking around you will be fascinated by the variety of seafood being prepared for sale to the city's restaurants.

I thought this was a really fun show. I went with my friends and thought that this was we needed to visit to complete our trip to Tokyo. The ticket is a bit pricey but for such an elaborate and random show it really is worth it. The food is nothing special but they sell drinks at the waiting room...

Heard this from my brother who also enjoyed the show last year. Then I saw Anthony Bourdain having a great time here---so we decided to give it a try.

We enjoyed the ""unique"" experience, because you obviously can't find this everywhere, and even if built for foreigners, it's real contemporary Japan.

The English friendliness of this establishment means that you're going to be surrounded by other tourists. You can be certain of that. If you want a more Japanese version, then you're going to need a Japanese person to set it up for you. That's just the way Japan is.
That said, if the presence of other foreigners isn't a turn...

The area of Kabukicho is worth the visit and shinjuku is one of my favourites places in Tokyo. This restaurant was well advertised all over the place and I feel pretty taken aback by the high position in the ranking among Tokyo places to visit.
Honestly, I expected more, a lot more from the performance.
Very touristic, only foreigners attend...

Yes, the show is a wild over the top spectacular of mermaids riding sharks, taiko drummers in bikinis etc. A sensory overload that is difficult to describe. The food was terrible as everyone said, stick to the overpriced popcorn.

Well what can I say about the Robot Restaurant, I don't think I'll ever experience anything like that again that's for sure. The pre-show is rather odd and to be honest we could have quite easily skipped it if we were allowed, seemed like a money maker than anything else.

Cheesiest and dreadful experience in the worst neighborhood of the city. Total waste of time. I am glad I came in late and didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes in the lounge before the main show started. I left the show as soon as I could. Tokyo has great places: skip this one.

We went to attend the show on the recommendation of a friend. The first bad surprise was the price...6,000 yens (about 40 Euros) per person, without dinner. So, it's called a restaurant but it's not.

She was able to answer all of our questions about Japanese food and it was obvious that she is passionate about cooking.

Going to Japan can sometimes be a hard task. As a ""gaijin"" (foreigner) you may not know to much of the language and as japanese people usually don't speak english... You got a bit of a problem in the communicatons department.
Going to resturants in Japan isn't necessarly a problem, but you'd rather wan't to bring something home with you,...

If you want to experience the REAL JAPANESE HOME COOKING,you should take this class!
WHY? Because I'm japanese.
I'd made MISO-SOUP,OYAKO-DON,OHITASHI and SUNOMONO in this class,these are the same menu as what japanese people are eating usually at home.
There is no difference between my mom's cooking and MARI's.
I recommend this class for all foreign tourists!

We visited Mari with our 2 friends whilst on holiday. She was very friendly and ok'd the menu with us before via email.
The cooking steps were broken down, so seemed very straight forward and we've recreated the dishes at home too.
We enjoyed visiting her home and seeing how real Japanese live.

My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the cooking class with Mari. We made Udon noodles and Dashi from scratch, for a really nice Udon Soup. We both thought the best part was getting to hang out with Mari and talk about life in Tokyo and the every day food Japanese people eat.

Totally loved Robot Restaurant!
One thing though: 'restaurant' is definitely a misnomer - it isn't about the food at all, so don't expect top-quality grub.
Instead, expect dancing robots, taiko drumming, mascot boxing battles, americana, and motorcycle riding!
I'd say this is a 'must-see' if you're in Tokyo...I just don't think there's anything else quite like it in the world....

Robot was like a laser light show crossed with a burlesque show that incorporated drums, robots, aliens and dinosaurs. It was well worth the price of admission and almost worth the plane fare from Australia to Japan.
The show we saw didn't have sexist, racist or offensive overtones and there was no nudity. It was heaps of fun.

Just go.
Don't think, just go.
Also...we stayed at a Royokan the previous night who had flyers for Robot Restaurant and that included a 2-for-1 pass, so we saved 50% on going. If you are staying at a hotel/royokan try and see if they have a Robot Restaurant flyer/coupon.
Anyways, Robot Restaurant was simply one of the most fun 90...

This is more of a show than a restaurant. They hand you a low-quality, cold bento box upon arrival and that's it for the food.
The venue and show, however, are over-the-top and a lot of fun. It's like Medieval Times crossed with Battlestar Galactica, with a sexy Vegas review thrown in to boot. It's almost impossible to describe.
