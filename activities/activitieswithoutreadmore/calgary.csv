First of all,the location is conveniently located right in the Beltline making it very easy to get to. From the outside it looks quite small but I can assure you that once you're inside it definitely opens up! I...

Poor customer service and the treatments were just 'ok'. Keep searching ....
The massage was good but very basic and not a spa caliber massage. Staff were quick to dismiss.
It was an average experience and average is most definitely not what you look for when booking your next spa visit.
I would not revisit or recommend.

I particularly appreciated the small details of the treatment - ex warm towel treatment for my feet and towel for covering my head (to avoid massage oil getting into my hair).

Take your little kiddies to Butterfield in the Spring when there are new baby animals. The farm has rustic charm. The animals may be approached (some of them.) There are pony rides, and other activities. My kids loved this place. But if you are allergic to hay and grass, bring tissues.

A great mall with lots of stores, sit down restaurants and a food court. Has a Safeway and Target. Probably the best mall in Calgary.

Out of all the malls in Calgary Market mall is my favorite. It is only one level so your not going up and down escalators or elevators or worse STAIRS.. There is tons of parking and a huge food court. If your looking for the pricey stores Market mall has them. If your looking for less expensive with good quality...

Market Mall is one of Calgarys four largest indoor malls (along with Southcentre, Chinook Centre, and Cross Iron Mills).
This is Calgarys only major indoor mall with heated underground parking, which is a real treat in the winter. You can leave your heavy winter coat in the car and shop in just your shirtsleeves. The underground parking can fill up...

I really like this mall; easy to get to, and it has a good mix of stores; not too large or exhausting,you can easily cover it in a few comfortable hours. The food court is good, and parking is easy and close. I especially like the BlueNotes location in this mall; great sales and fun tshirts; nice jeans in many...
