I went on the Dallas Segway tour with family who was visiting from the UK. None of us had ever been on a Segway before and were a little nervous. They gave us great training and soon we were ""segging"" our way around Dallas like pros.
Don't worry about taking a camera, they will be snapping pictures the whole time....

We have taken many Segway tours with some being great, and some were actually poor or boring. Our guide with Dallas Segway Tours seemed very experienced with lots of great information and history, but delivered in a way that the history was not boring. I would rate this as one of the better Segway experiences we have enjoyed.

Very good directions to and from hotel, individual instruction was excellent, safety was emphasized, helpful restaurant and area information provided.

My wife and I are now convinced that a segway is the best way to take a tour. They are so much fun and you are able to cover a wider area and so many more attractions than other methods. Neither my wife nor I had ever ridden a segway and are pretty awkward when it comes to anything physical....

This is a nice market, food stalls, etc and this weekend they had live music. There is a lot of potential here. I am not sure exactly what they need but they need more of everything. Takes about 20 to 30 minutes to see it all. I hope they are able to bring in more vendors.
Nice destination to bike...

This is a more expensive tour company, but it is well worth it. They spend extra time training you on the Segway, which is important. We had an awesome tour guide, Cyndi. She had a lot of knowledge about the downtown area. They take pictures for you and download them to the internet. The Segway was so much fun!!!

This was the most family fun we've had in a long time! As a Christmas gift, our grown children and their spouses picked a weekend they could all agree on to come to Dallas. We learned about historic Dallas and thoroughly enjoyed each other AND the tour guides (they were full of personality!). We laughed and learned for 2.5 hours....

Dallas Segway Tours has got to be the best way to get your initial overview of downtown Dallas. When you visit New York City, take the Circle Line boat trip of Manhattan for an overview. In Dallas, accomplish the same thing with a Segway tour. The staff are super-friendly, your tour guide knows a bit of the history of Dallas,...

""Dallas Segways"" were such a great way to see downtown. We did the West End Adventure tour and had fun on the segways while seeing the historic district with a personal tour guide. Loads of pictures, interesting parks, great art, and fun machines to glide by with a professional staff. Definitely would do this again!

If new to Dallas, or even if you have visited before, we would highly recommend the Dallas Segway Tours. This is a great way to see the important sites of the city in a 2-hour, fun-filled ride on a Segway. If you have never used a Segway, they will teach you in 10 minutes what you need to know. Our...
