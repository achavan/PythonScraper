This is a warning to all those thinking of using Thames River Services not to trust anything that you are told by those at the ticket desk. In fact I would avoid them all together. Although they will take you to the Tower of London, if you are looking to go to Greenwich or during the summer the Thames barrier...

We took the Thames Clipper to get back from an event at the Excel Center. It's way out to hell and gone, and this made the return so simple. It was raining and cold, but inside it was perfect. By the time you finish your beer and a bag of crisps, you are at the edge of Westminster bridge.

Unfortunately we chose a beer that a group of us considered undrinkable - apart from the few occasions when a beer has been off, this is unheard of. Perhaps it was just a very esoteric taste, very!

Booked this tour on recommendation from a friend. Definitely worth the price and you have to book - good as the other tour groups wandering around had twice as many people as our group. Phillip was really knowledgeable and friendly, and got a good many laughs out of the group (despite the subject matter!)
Thanks for a good evening.

Having been inspired by our free alternative walking tour of Berlin we decided to join Gregory on his walking tour of London. Gregory's passion and understanding of London sub-culture was a refreshing change from the stale traditional tours. We enjoyed his cheeky sense of humour and our teenage daughter has mastered his signature South London strut. Unmissable experience!

The St James bar is my most favourite hotel bar in London. I live in London so have never stayed at the hotel but visit the bar at least twice a month. It's a superbly intimate and beautifully decorated bar.
Nothing......absolutely nothing is too much for the staff. The drinks are great and the service is second to none.

The food stalls were unbelievable & amazing value.

Owner description
Elizabeth Tower is the name of the famous tower of Parliament - more popularly known as Big Ben. Although often referred to as Big Ben, this is actually the nickname of the bell housed within Elizabeth Tower - and Big Ben's official name is the Great Bell. UK residents can arrange a tour of Elizabeth Tower through their local MP or member of the House of Lords. Unfortunately these tours are not available to non-UK residents.

dont bother going inside the Clock Tower.
anyway you will probably only know ""big ben"" from the picture of the tower and not actually of the bell.
that area is really crowded and in the middle of a big road crossing with heavy trafic.
it's not as romantic as it looks on postcards

Absolutely stunning building. You cannot compare it to postcards/photos that you have seen. The details on this building are so beautiful and definitely worth a visit. Very busy and touristy area.

Can't recommend this highly enough. We had an amazing time and were buzzing for ages afterwards. The hour went so quickly and we couldn't stop talking about the clues and what we should have done.
Perfect for a group of friends or work social. Would love to do it again!

This was my first time trying out SUP and it didn't disappoint. My instructor Mo was really encouraging, fun and got me on my feet super quick. Really fun and relaxing experience. Active 360 is a well run company and I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting to give SUP a go. Even the rain didn't put me off!

I chose the 67.50 tickets in the dress circle & the view of the stage was great, perfect view throughout the performance.
The performance was a delight, absolutely breathtaking, but very emotional so take your tissues!!
I really can't say enough good things & I hope to get the opportunity to see Les Mis again one day.
Enjoy! Its worth...

There is little to dislike here. The dress circle is short on isles so there is quite a bit of shuffling past to get to your seat. The theatre staff were very friendly and helpful.

Everyone tells you that after a brief time you forget these are puppets and you see them as real horses - and that's absolutely right! You do! It was totally fascinating how they captured every movement and made the horse come to life. A wonderful evening, a very poignant and moving show. Highly recommended!

What can one say except WOW! It is now moving to Johannesburg, which is about time, given that the whole concept comes from South African engineering.
