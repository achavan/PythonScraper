The sign at the machine displays the cost as $2.25 but once you put that in, then you need 3 more quarters. The sign should say the cash fare is $3.00 so you put in dollar bills rather than need more quarters. It is dishonest to have tourists misled what the cost is.

We visited the Old Town Ale House late Saturday night and I'm not really sure what to say in a review of the place. It is fairly unassuming from the outside and that theme continues indoors where the bar comes off intially as unremarkable in most ways.

My husband, son and I went to this as our 1 fun thing on a recent business trip. These songs are just before my generation and I loved every minute.

Entertaining show with laughs and great music. Would go again. Purchased our tixs through hottix.org and saved a ton. Recommend to all ages. Purchased drinks onsite that we took into the theater when the show began. Loved the history of great musical legends.

Jay Pritzker Pavilion is an amazing work of architecture and design a fantastic place for a concert. The structure itself is quite beautiful and very interesting. Behind the seating is a huge grass open seating area that just begs to sat on. The place reminds you of an old small town band shell, but completing modernized and urbanized- bigger, fancier...

The building's interior is a dazzling,colorful example of the architecture and decorative style of its age. We saw Richard Strauss' ""Capriccio"" there. The acoustics are excellent. Because the building is so enormous, we felt very far from the stage even though we were in the second row of the dress circle. This did not in any way spoil our pleasure,...
