I like this museum, but the strange modern design makes it difficult to get around. I also am surprised by the relatively small number of works on display - a lot of space for a little art. The underground parking is convenient.

This was so interesting to actually be in the book depository that made history. I enjoyed all the photos and the stories being retold. Looking out of the windows down at the 'x's on the street was eerie. A must see if in Dallas

This is not the Met. However, it is a nice museum with a good solid collection. Many of the antiques have been refinished to Georgia and back by the late Ms Hogg. We go back frequently.

Went here on a rainy day and enjoyed the variety of art displayed here. You have plenty of different art from 1700 historical art to modern day sculptures and displays of ""stuff"". It's free to get in and parking is $10 for underground, which I would recommend to use for an easy walking commute around Dallas. The museum has plenty...

This is one place in Dallas I truly love. It has quite a few floors, and on each one there is a wide variety of collections, ranging from Native American to Ancient Greek to contemporary. I personally love the landscapes of the American West, with my favorite being one of a mountain pass in Green River, Wyoming. There is also...

The Dallas Museum of Art is only a short distance from the convention center (which is what brought me to Dallas) and it houses a wonderful collection of art from around the world. The layout is slightly confusing at first, but the front desk staff and docents are friendly and quickly willing to assist in any questions. The creative zone...

Ok I know they are bad but I now have intimate knowledge of the level of badness.
It was a good side trip we walked one way and took the dart back.
The campus is large and tasteful. We checked out the ""boulevard"" on the way into the game. It was quite the scene. Beautiful young scantily clad students partying...
