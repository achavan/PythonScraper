Money has often been an issue, but I\'ve learned that travel doesn\'t have to require going a great distance, as there is a lot to discover in California itself. But when I have had the chances to go abroad, I have experienced several different circumstances: I\'ve traveled with young children and then teens and fellow adults (as my kids have grown). I\'ve traveled solo and as part of a couple as well. For me, travel means taking the time to explore and discover, not just seeing the ""required"" sites. I love to walk through cities as much as possible so that I I see the places (small ""p"") as well as the Places. There are times when I have splurged, but times when I have been on a very tight budget. (Traveling with a family of 5, you almost have to splurge just for budget accommodations!)

I found books from quite unknown English authors among a very varied choice , there's a wide selection of poetry as well. This place is a real readers' paradise.
