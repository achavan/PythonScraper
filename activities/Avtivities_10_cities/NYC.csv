","NY Waterway is the fastest and easiest way to and from Manhattan. Up through the 1800's, ferries were the only way to get to and around Manhattan. As bridges and tunnels were built, ferry transportation faded. In 1986, Arthur E. Imperatore and his family rejuvenated the NY Harbor with the launch of the first NY Waterway boat. Since then, NY Waterway has carried over 65 million passengers. NY Waterway has the largest ferry and excursion fleet in the NY Harbor, but it is still a family business with all the personal attention to service and amenities that it had when it was just Arthur's ferry. You are treated like family from the moment you step into our terminal. Some people say a NY Waterway cruise is the friendliest experience they have had in New York. We say ""welcome aboard!""",5 of 5 stars,"
We have been to NYC many times, but never done a harbour tour. I wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, but didn't want to spend 5 hours on a tour. This company has 90 minute river cruises, and the tour guide was full of fun facts and loads of history. He really was great. The sights were very comprehensive,...

","The unique concept behind City Food Tours was developed in New York City when Joyce Weinberg, a seasoned food industry professional with more than 20 years of experience, wanted to share her passion for fine foods. From managing Fortune 500 confectionery businesses, to buying gourmet chocolates for Bloomingdales, shes done it all. Compared to other existing tours that focus on more common foods, CFT introduces tour guests to a vast offering of high-quality, artisanal foods and encourage them to support local specialty stores, farmers, and sustainable agriculture. We help people realize that theres a lot more out there than the processed foods they encounter in mega-marts.",,"

The timing with which I finally felt the need to push this thing to fruition came from the seasonality of the holidays! Although it can be exhausting at times, we do get to enjoy all four seasons in full, here in NY. So, why wouldnt I take advantage of that?

The reason is, this site is often full of reviews of complaints regarding things that could have been rectified by speaking with the hotel, instead, nothing is mentioned and the hotel slated. I don't like that. The hotels I stay in dont have to be 5* but many are as I tend to hunt downs deals thru work.

","The Rockefeller Center Tour celebrates the rich history and exciting presence of New York's architectural jewel. The center was the ambitious vision of a young John D. Rockefeller and hosts more than 100 breathtaking works of art. In addition to housing NBC, Radio City Music Hall and Christie's Auction House, Rockefeller Plaza is also the home of the world-famous skating rink visited by more than half a million people every year.",5 of 5 stars,"
Rockefeller center is best known for its Christmas tree and skating rink. A lot of people ignore the Top of the Rock, which is the observatory on top of the center building. But trust me that it is an attraction worth seeing...I would rate it comparable to the Empire state building experience.
It is better to book the tickets online...

Not a restaurant. Just one of Greenwich Village's most enduring ethnic food treasures. All kinds of fresh meat cuts, ready for your kitchen. Sunday gravy to go.

My extended family bought out sessions of Escape the Agency and Escape the Office. We had eight people for each game ranging in age from 16 to 63. We considered ourselves experts at puzzle solving so we thought with eight smart people, the task would be easy. We did win both our games, but we were thrilled to find them...

If you like tall buildings and pretty skylines then you'll love Manhattan Skyline. In my opinion it's best viewed from a tall building or a view point, such as Top of The Rock at Rockefeller Center or the iconic Empire State Building.
You can also get cheaper views from the river boats (such as the free south ferry) or accross...

Performances - outstanding. Costumes - magnificent. Staging and Puppetry - unparalleled. Best show on Broadway - undoubtedly. If you can only see one show on Broadway, this is the one. First show I ever saw on Broadway almost 17 years ago and a few weeks ago - still my favorite. It is thrilling, exciting, and memorable.

I am a stickler for location, nice beds, nice linen and bathrooms, but most of all good value. If I have an issue with the hotel, I like to give them the chance to fix it before mentioning it in a negative light on here. The reason is, this site is often full of reviews of complaints regarding things that could have been rectified by speaking with the hotel, instead, nothing is mentioned and the hotel slated. I don't like that. The hotels I stay in dont have to be 5* but many are as I tend to hunt downs deals thru work. I have been travelling since I was 5, lived overseas for 14 years and worked on cruise ships for 5, so have seen a lot. My focus now is to do things a little bit different, or focus on things I have missed. I hunt down quirky options and fine restaurants. Just because a hotel is not to my taste, doesn't mean it is isnt worth staying there. I'll let you know that.

I have waited to see this on Broadway. Just go. That's all I can say.
I cried at the end as I was so taken by the whole experience.
