I would like to share my experience as a vendor. we never received our payment for the deal that ran back in March od 2014. Today is Sept.30th od 2014. Horrible, unprofessional customer service. Accounting department takes zero responsibility, gives fake promises and makes up stories. 45minute waiting time to speak with the management. DO NOT USE BUYTOPIA!

The main area is underground and is designed properly - nothing realy fancy but I liked it. They have a nice beer selection and some starters if you are a bit hungry....

It is not top gourmet, but this is one of the best tasting, best value restaurants in Toronto.
The Tandoori Kebob is heavenly, a really generous portion, a heap of delicious rice, and a salad also!
The consistency is superb, we come there about once a week and have never been disappointed.

Started with the oysters. Big, tasty, salty, umami. Smashed these with some horseradish, Tobasco and vinegar. How to beat this? I guess a lobster roll fits the bill - the sweet taste of the lobster worked well with the sweet roll. The restaurant was a relaxed affair, I felt chilled not rushed.
